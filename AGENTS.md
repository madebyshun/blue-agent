# AGENTS.md — Blue Agent

## What is Blue Agent

**Blue Agent** is an AI agent layer built on Base — it interacts with users, automates tasks, and generates onchain activity.

Blue Agent is the flagship AI agent of the Base ecosystem. It is not just a chatbot — it is a full economic actor: it holds a wallet, executes onchain transactions, earns and distributes tokens, and powers a growing ecosystem of tools and services.

**Two surfaces:**
- **Founder console** (this repo) — AI-native workflow for Base builders: idea → build → audit → ship → raise. MCP-native — runs inside Codex Desktop, Cursor & Codex (`https://blueagent.dev/api/mcp`). *Not a tool you open. A layer you build on.*
- **x402 API services** — pay-per-use AI tools (USDC on Base, EIP-3009) for agents and developers. Each of the 5 commands is backed by a cluster of hub tools (e.g. audit → risk_gate · honeypot · phishing_scan · key_exposure · protocol_risk).

> Note: the Telegram bot surface is **no longer in active development** (as of 2026-06). Focus is the 5 commands + their hub tool clusters.

**Tokens:**
- `$BLUEAGENT` — `0xf895783b2931c919955e18b5e3343e7c7c456ba3` (Base, Uniswap v4)

## This repo — Founder Console

The `blue-agent` repo is the **AI-native founder console for Base builders**. It is a workflow-first product for thinking, building, auditing, shipping, and raising on Base — powered by Virtuals inference and monetized via self-hosted x402 micropayments.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | Next.js 15 frontend + **the entire live x402 surface** — founder console UI, `AGENT_TOOLS` catalog, all tool compute, self-hosted x402 settled via the Coinbase CDP facilitator (payTo `0x0295…` — see Hard rule 6) |
| ~~`apps/api`~~ ~~`apps/portal`~~ | 🗑️ **DELETED 2026-08-18.** The Bankr x402 storefront and the `api.blueagent.dev` portal. Both dead before removal — no Vercel project, no importers, `api.blueagent.dev` 404s. Do not recreate; `git log --all -- apps/api apps/portal` has the old text. |
| ~~`packages/bankr`~~ | 🗑️ **DELETED 2026-09-18.** Was a `private: true` Bankr LLM client (`llm.bankr.bot`, `BANKR_API_KEY`) with zero importers. Bankr 403-banned 2026-07-20. Inference is Virtuals via `apps/web/src/app/api/_lib/llm.ts` — do not recreate. |
| `packages/core` | Shared schemas, command pricing, and tool input definitions |
| `packages/payments` | x402 payment helpers |
| Chains | **Base (8453)** — primary tokenized-stock venue (Coinbase B20) + every non-RH tool. **Robinhood Chain (4663)** — second live venue; the ~30 `rh-*` tools and the RWA registry are RH-specific. Never assume which; state it. |

## Aeon Skills (installed from BankrBot/skills)

Five Aeon skills are bundled in `skills/` and available to any command or agent session:

| Skill | File | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `aeon-token-movers` | `skills/aeon-token-movers.md` | "what's pumping", "top movers today", pre-trade scan |
| `aeon-token-pick` | `skills/aeon-token-pick.md` | "give me a token pick", "asymmetric setup today" |
| `aeon-narrative-tracker` | `skills/aeon-narrative-tracker.md` | "what's running on CT", "narrative positions", content ideas |
| `aeon-deep-research` | `skills/aeon-deep-research.md` | "DD on X", "build me a memo", "contrarian take" |
| `aeon-distribute-tokens` | `skills/aeon-distribute-tokens.md` | Weekly $BLUEAGENT rewards payout to leaderboard |

When a user request matches a trigger phrase, load the skill file and follow its output rules. All Aeon skills are **read-to-apply** — no extra setup required except `aeon-distribute-tokens` which needs `BANKR_API_KEY` with Wallet write scope — ⚠️ **assume dead until tested**: that is Bankr's *Wallet* API, a different endpoint from the 403-banned `llm.bankr.bot`, but it authenticates against the same Bankr account, and no code in this repo reads `BANKR_API_KEY` any more. Verify before relying on a payout run.

## Hard rules

1. **Two live stock venues — Base (8453) leads, Robinhood Chain (4663) is also covered. Never assume either; state which one, every time.** Base is the primary tokenized-stock venue (Coinbase B20 — the `*c` share tokens Blue Hood polls) and all product copy is Base-first. RH Chain is a real second venue, not a fallback or a legacy shim: the ~30 `rh-*` tools and the RWA registry are RH-specific and stay that way. **A ticker can exist on BOTH chains** (NVDA / META / GOOGL currently do), so a ticker string alone never identifies a token — chain + address does. Never suggest Ethereum mainnet. An address, RPC call, or explorer link is meaningless without its chain, and RH and Base share neither.
   *(Corrected 2026-08-24: this rule previously called Base "legacy — older non-RH tools", which was true before the Base desk went live and is now wrong in the direction that matters.)*

2. **All contract addresses must be verified on the explorer for their own chain** — Basescan for Base (8453), `robinhoodchain.blockscout.com` for RH Chain (4663). The two chains share no state: an RH contract does not exist on Basescan and a Base B20 does not exist on RH's explorer, so an explorer check only counts on the token's own chain. **Never resolve a stock token by ticker string** — for a Base B20, cross-check the address against the official `base.org/stocks` table and assert it on-chain (`isB20`, `decimals == 8`, `symbol == "<TICKER>c"`); name-matching a ticker is exactly how an impostor gets in (real bug, #280). Never invent or guess a contract address. If an address is needed and not already in the codebase, flag it for the user to supply. Format: `0x…` — always full checksum address.

3. **Use Virtuals for all AI calls.** Import `callLLM` from `apps/web/src/app/api/_lib/llm.ts`. Do NOT call OpenAI, Anthropic, Bankr, or Venice directly. The endpoint is `https://compute.virtuals.io/v1`, key `process.env.VIRTUALS_API_KEY`. **Do not write new `callBankrLLM` / `callVeniceLLM` calls** — those are compatibility shims that delegate to Virtuals, kept only so ~46 legacy importers compile; their names describe providers this repo no longer uses (Bankr 403-banned 2026-07-20, Venice removed from the fallback chain 2026-07-25). `packages/bankr` was deleted 2026-09-18.

4. **No hallucinated addresses, ever.** If you don't have a verified address, say so. Do not fill in placeholders that look like real addresses.

5. **Business logic lives in packages, not in the app.** Keep `apps/web` thin. Schemas, pricing, and tool definitions belong in `packages/core`.

6. **payTo is `0x02950ad38ada1d599375bd447e080cd404809205` (Base 8453) — changed 2026-08-18.** Every off-chain payee is this wallet, the same one that receives Blue Chat credit top-ups. The old `0xb058a1e305d9c720aa5b1bf42b6f2f6294b03b5f` (Bankr Club wallet) is **retired** — do not reintroduce it. Server `PAY_TO` (`api/_lib/x402-cdp.ts`) and client `PAY_TO_WALLET` (`hub/HubView.tsx`) **must change in lockstep**: the browser signs `authorization.to` against the client value, so divergence fails CDP verification on *every* Hub payment.
   ⚠️ **Two deployed contracts still pay the old wallet and cannot be redirected** — the **live** B20HUB pair: `B20HUB_HOOK`.`TREASURY()` and `B20HUB_BUYBACK`.`payoutRecipient()` (both names as exported from `lib/b20hub/constants.ts`), Base 8453, each set once in the constructor. The buyback one has **no setter by deliberate design** so a hostile owner can't redirect staker yield. Only a redeploy changes them, and redeploying the V4 hook changes its address (permission bits) and would require a new pool. Editing the `.sol` source changes nothing — the deployed bytecode is what pays. **Re-measured 2026-09-18** via `cast call` against `mainnet.base.org`: hook `0xACbBD784…d200` → `0xB058A1E3…3b5f`; buyback `0xe389AcfA…A1c9` → `0xB058A1E3…3b5f`. Both still the retired wallet.
   🔴 **This paragraph used to name `0xe3B801…0061200` and `0xBCF026…005175B4` — both SUPERSEDED deployments.** `constants.ts` labels the first one `B20HUB_HOOK_V3_BROKEN` in so many words. The *fact* was right and the *addresses* were wrong, which is the worse of the two: the exemption read as on-chain-verified while pointing at contracts that collect nothing. **Record an exception by the name the code exports, never by a bare hex literal.**

## The 5 core commands

Each has a contract doc in `commands/`.

| Command | What it does | Price |
|---|---|---|
| `blue idea` | Turns a rough concept into a fundable brief — problem, why now, why Base, MVP scope, risks, 24h plan | $0.05 |
| `blue build` | Architecture, stack, folder structure, files, integrations, and test plan | $0.50 |
| `blue audit` | Security and product risk review — critical issues, suggested fixes, go/no-go | $1.00 |
| `blue ship` | Deployment checklist, verification steps, release notes, monitoring plan | $0.10 |
| `blue raise` | Pitch narrative — market framing, why this wins, traction, ask, target investors | $0.20 |

Pricing is defined in `packages/core/src/schemas.ts` → `BLUE_AGENT_PRICING`.

## Commit convention

```
feat:     new feature
fix:      bug fix
skill:    new skill or grounding file added
cmd:      changes to a command contract (commands/*.md)
docs:     documentation only
refactor: code restructure, no behavior change
chore:    tooling, deps, config
```

---

## Branch policy

**Cut a short-lived branch from `main`, PR it back into `main`, delete it on merge.** Never commit
directly to `main`. **`dev` is retired (2026-09-05) — do not branch from it or re-create it**; see
Git discipline in `CLAUDE.md` for the two measured reasons (61-file drift, and `dev` silently lacking
the CI workflow so `verify` never ran on any `dev` commit).

---

## Build & deploy workflow

**Build locally first, then deploy.** Never push to `main` (which auto-deploys
to production) until the change has passed a full local build. This catches
errors before they burn a Vercel deploy slot — the free plan caps at **100
deployments/day**, and a failed build wastes one.

Pipeline for every change, in order:

```
1. Edit code
2. npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json   # type errors (fast) — run from apps/web
3. npm run build                        # next build — lint, prerender, server/client import errors
4. Manual runtime test at localhost     # logic/UX bugs a build can't catch
5. Only when 2–4 PASS → open a PR (branch→main); merge only when the Vercel preview is green
```

Notes:
- `tsc --noEmit` only catches **types**. `next build` additionally catches
  **ESLint errors, prerender failures, and server/client boundary mistakes** —
  exactly the class of error that makes a Vercel build fail.
- Step 4 is **mandatory** for sensitive changes (wallet, payments, on-chain,
  credit metering) — those break at **runtime**, not build time. A clean build
  is necessary but not sufficient.
- `next build` and `next dev` share the `.next/` directory — **stop the dev
  server before running a build** or `.next` can corrupt.
- Deploy = one `git push origin main` after the quota resets. **Do not** create
  empty `chore: trigger production redeploy` commits — they burn deploy slots.
  If `main` doesn't auto-deploy, the cause is almost always the daily cap, not
  the GitHub integration.

**Deploy target:** production is the Vercel project **`blueagent-web-new`**
(`blueagent.dev`). Never deploy to or recreate the `blue-agent` project.
