# CLAUDE.md — Blue Agent

## What is Blue Agent

**Blue Agent** is an AI agent layer built on Base — it interacts with users, automates tasks, and generates onchain activity.

Blue Agent is the flagship AI agent of the Base ecosystem. It is not just a chatbot — it is a full economic actor: it holds a wallet, executes onchain transactions, earns and distributes tokens, and powers a growing ecosystem of tools and services.

**Two surfaces:**
- **Founder console** (this repo) — AI-native workflow for Base builders: idea → build → audit → ship → raise. MCP-native — runs inside Claude Desktop, Cursor & Claude Code (`https://blueagent.dev/api/mcp`). *Not a tool you open. A layer you build on.*
- **x402 API services** — pay-per-use AI tools (USDC on Base, EIP-3009) for agents and developers. Each of the 5 commands is backed by a cluster of hub tools (e.g. audit → risk_gate · honeypot · phishing_scan · key_exposure · protocol_risk).

> Note: the Telegram bot surface is **no longer in active development** (as of 2026-06). Focus is the 5 commands + their hub tool clusters.

**Tokens:**
- `$BLUEAGENT` — `0xf895783b2931c919955e18b5e3343e7c7c456ba3` (Base, Uniswap v4)

## This repo — Founder Console

The `blue-agent` repo is the **AI-native founder console for Base builders**. It is a workflow-first product for thinking, building, auditing, shipping, and raising on Base — powered by Bankr LLM and monetized via x402 micropayments.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | Next.js 15 frontend — founder console UI |
| `apps/api` | x402 paid API services (risk-gate, deep-analysis, wallet-pnl, etc.) |
| `packages/bankr` | Bankr LLM client — wraps `https://llm.bankr.bot/v1/messages` |
| `packages/core` | Shared schemas, command pricing, and tool input definitions |
| `packages/payments` | x402 payment helpers |
| Base chain | All on-chain actions are Base only (chain ID 8453) |

## Aeon Skills (installed from BankrBot/skills)

Five Aeon skills are bundled in `skills/` and available to any command or agent session:

| Skill | File | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `aeon-token-movers` | `skills/aeon-token-movers.md` | "what's pumping", "top movers today", pre-trade scan |
| `aeon-token-pick` | `skills/aeon-token-pick.md` | "give me a token pick", "asymmetric setup today" |
| `aeon-narrative-tracker` | `skills/aeon-narrative-tracker.md` | "what's running on CT", "narrative positions", content ideas |
| `aeon-deep-research` | `skills/aeon-deep-research.md` | "DD on X", "build me a memo", "contrarian take" |
| `aeon-distribute-tokens` | `skills/aeon-distribute-tokens.md` | Weekly $BLUEAGENT rewards payout to leaderboard |

When a user request matches a trigger phrase, load the skill file and follow its output rules. All Aeon skills are **read-to-apply** — no extra setup required except `aeon-distribute-tokens` which needs `BANKR_API_KEY` with Wallet write scope.

## Hard rules

1. **Base chain only.** Never suggest Ethereum mainnet. All contract addresses, RPC calls, and on-chain actions target Base (chain ID 8453). Mention Base explicitly in every on-chain context.

2. **All contract addresses must be verified on Basescan.** Never invent or guess a contract address. If an address is needed and not already in the codebase, flag it for the user to supply. Format: `0x…` — always full checksum address.

3. **Use Bankr LLM for all AI calls.** Import from `packages/bankr` and call `callBankrLLM()`. Do NOT call OpenAI, Anthropic, or any other LLM API directly. The endpoint is `https://llm.bankr.bot/v1/messages`. API key is `process.env.BANKR_API_KEY`.

4. **No hallucinated addresses, ever.** If you don't have a verified address, say so. Do not fill in placeholders that look like real addresses.

5. **Business logic lives in packages, not in the app.** Keep `apps/web` thin. Schemas, pricing, and tool definitions belong in `packages/core`.

## The 5 core commands

Each has a contract doc in `commands/`.

| Command | What it does | Price |
|---|---|---|
| `blue idea` | Turns a rough concept into a fundable brief — problem, why now, why Base, MVP scope, risks, 24h plan | $0.05 |
| `blue build` | Architecture, stack, folder structure, files, integrations, and test plan | $0.50 |
| `blue audit` | Security and product risk review — critical issues, suggested fixes, go/no-go | $1.00 |
| `blue ship` | Deployment checklist, verification steps, release notes, monitoring plan | $0.10 |
| `blue raise` | Pitch narrative — market framing, why this wins, traction, ask, target investors | $0.20 |

Pricing is defined in `packages/core/src/schemas.ts` → `BLUE_AGENT_PRICING`.

## Commit convention

```
feat:     new feature
fix:      bug fix
skill:    new skill or grounding file added
cmd:      changes to a command contract (commands/*.md)
docs:     documentation only
refactor: code restructure, no behavior change
chore:    tooling, deps, config
```

---

## Branch policy

**Always work on `dev`.** Never commit directly to `main`. PRs go `dev → main`.

---

## Build & deploy workflow

**Build locally first, then deploy.** Never push to `main` (which auto-deploys
to production) until the change has passed a full local build. This catches
errors before they burn a Vercel deploy slot — the free plan caps at **100
deployments/day**, and a failed build wastes one.

Pipeline for every change, in order:

```
1. Edit code
2. npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.json   # type errors (fast) — run from apps/web
3. npm run build                        # next build — lint, prerender, server/client import errors
4. Manual runtime test at localhost     # logic/UX bugs a build can't catch
5. Only when 2–4 PASS → merge dev→main → push (single deploy)
```

Notes:
- `tsc --noEmit` only catches **types**. `next build` additionally catches
  **ESLint errors, prerender failures, and server/client boundary mistakes** —
  exactly the class of error that makes a Vercel build fail.
- Step 4 is **mandatory** for sensitive changes (wallet, payments, on-chain,
  credit metering) — those break at **runtime**, not build time. A clean build
  is necessary but not sufficient.
- `next build` and `next dev` share the `.next/` directory — **stop the dev
  server before running a build** or `.next` can corrupt.
- Deploy = one `git push origin main` after the quota resets. **Do not** create
  empty `chore: trigger production redeploy` commits — they burn deploy slots.
  If `main` doesn't auto-deploy, the cause is almost always the daily cap, not
  the GitHub integration.

**Deploy target:** production is the Vercel project **`blueagent-web-new`**
(`blueagent.dev`). Never deploy to or recreate the `blue-agent` project.
