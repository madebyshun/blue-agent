**AI-native founder console + tool marketplace for Base builders.**

Blue Agent is a full economic actor on Base: it holds a wallet, executes onchain transactions, powers a growing ecosystem of tools, and helps builders go from idea to shipped product.

## Blue Hub — 111 AI Tools on Base

Blue Hub is a curated marketplace of 111 pay-per-call AI tools built on Base. Any agent or developer can call tools via x402 micropayments in USDC — no API key, no account, no human in the loop.

```bash
# Discover all tools + prices
GET https://blueagent.dev/api/catalog

# Machine-readable x402 pricing
GET https://blueagent.dev/.well-known/pricing

# Call any tool
POST https://blueagent.dev/api/x402/{tool-id}
X-Payment: <EIP-3009 USDC on Base>
```

**111 tools across 12 categories** — on-chain · security · data · intelligence · builder · trading · content · agent-economy · base-ecosystem · earn · signal · portfolio

<!-- Both numbers above, and every other tool count in this file, are pinned to
     `TOOL_COUNT` by apps/web/scripts/docs-truth-check.ts, which runs in CI. -->

Registry: [ERC-8257 ToolRegistry](https://basescan.org/address/0x265BB2DBFC0A8165C9A1941Eb1372F349baD2cf1) · [agentic.market](https://agentic.market) · [CDP Bazaar](https://www.coinbase.com/developer-platform)

## x402 SDK

```bash
npm install @blueagent/x402
```

```typescript
import { createX402Client } from "@blueagent/x402"

const client = createX402Client({ privateKey: "0x..." })

// 5 core commands
const brief = await client.idea("gasless USDC tipping app on Base")
const arch  = await client.build("...")
const audit = await client.audit("0x<contract>")
const ship  = await client.ship("...")
const raise = await client.raise("...")

// Any Hub tool
const pick  = await client.tokenPick()
const news  = await client.hub("ecosystem-digest", { focus: "DeFi" })

// Discover pricing
const manifest = await client.pricing()
const price    = await client.priceOf("blue-audit") // { priceUSD: "$1.00" }
```

The SDK handles the full x402 flow: `402 → decode requirements → sign EIP-3009 → retry → 200 OK`

## 5 Core Commands

| Command | What it does | Price |
|---|---|---|
| `blue idea` | Rough concept → fundable brief | $0.05 |
| `blue build` | Brief → architecture + stack + file tree | $0.50 |
| `blue audit` | Code → security review + go/no-go | $1.00 |
| `blue ship` | Project → deploy checklist + release notes | $0.10 |
| `blue raise` | Idea → pitch narrative + investor framing | $0.20 |

---

## Install CLI

```bash
npm install -g @blueagent/cli
```

```bash
export VIRTUALS_API_KEY=your_key_here
blueagent
```

Inference runs through Virtuals (`compute.virtuals.io`). This line said
`export BANKR_API_KEY` until 2026-09-18 — an instruction that could not work for
anyone: Blue Agent's Bankr account has answered `403 {"banned":true}` on every
verb since 2026-07-20, so the first grounded command a new user ran would fail
with an auth error against a key they had just been told to set. A README is the
first thing a stranger trusts, so a dead setup step costs more than a dead
feature further down.

Navigate with `↑ ↓ Enter`. Press `Esc` to go back.

### Categories in the TUI

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Build** | idea · build · audit · ship · raise |
| **Intelligence** | base-alpha · token-alpha · protocol-health · founder-check · narrative-pulse · token-pick-signal · ecosystem-digest · market-fit · blue-research |
| **On-chain** | token-price · pool-scan · wallet-holdings · new-pools · gas-tracker · scam-detector · cross-protocol-yield · whale-tracker · dex-flow · aml-screen · airdrop-check |
| **Security** | quick-safety · wallet-risk · honeypot-check · risk-gate · deep-analysis · contract-trust · key-exposure · token-distribution · liquidity-depth |
| **Builder** | roadmap-validator · competitor-scan · pitch-intelligence · gtm-brief · stack-recommender · investor-memo · repo-health · builder-deep-dd · grant-evaluator |
| **Trading** | whale-copy-signal · token-momentum-scanner |
| **Content** | thread-intelligence · community-growth-playbook |
| **Earn** | lp-analyzer · cross-protocol-yield |

Two categories the TUI still renders are **not** listed above, because they do not
work and listing them as features is how a stranger loses an afternoon:

- **Bankr** (`swap · transfer · portfolio · launch-token`) — routed through Blue
  Agent's Bankr account, which has answered `403 {"banned":true,"banType":"restricted"}`
  on every verb since 2026-07-20. Reads were carved out as still-working when
  measured on 2026-09-06; that carve-out expired — `GET /v1/usage` answered 403 on
  2026-09-18. The ban is account-level, so a different API key does not help.
- **Tasks** (`post-task · accept · submit · list`) — the microtask marketplace was
  retired on 2026-09-02 and its six API routes were deleted, so these commands
  call endpoints that no longer exist.

Both still ship in `@blueagent/cli`. Removing them from the package is a published-package
change, not a README edit, and is tracked separately.

### System check

```bash
blue doctor
```

## Blue Chat

The browser terminal folded into Blue Chat at
[app.blueagent.dev/chat](https://app.blueagent.dev/chat) — all 111 Hub tools, the
5 core commands, and onchain queries, in the browser. No install required.
(`/terminal` still 301s there, so old links keep working.)

```
blue hub ls                    # list all 111 tools
blue hub info token-pick-signal
blue idea <prompt>             # $0.05, inference via Virtuals
blue balance 0x...             # ETH + USDC on Base mainnet
```

---

## Blue Tasks

A local ledger for tracking work — post a job, accept it, submit proof. It records
who did what and what is owed. **It moves no money and it is not a marketplace:**
there is no server, no escrow, and no chain call anywhere in these commands.
Settling up is between the two people.

```bash
# Persists to ~/.blue-agent/microtasks.json
blue micro post "audit this contract for reentrancy" \
  --reward 5 --slots 1 --proof url --deadline 2026-12-31
blue micro list
blue micro claim <taskId> @handle
blue micro approve <claimId>       # marks it owed; sends nothing
```

The `blue post-task` / `tasks` / `accept` / `submit` group is a **separate draft
tool** backed by an in-memory store (`packages/reputation` → `taskHub.ts`), so its
state does not survive the process — every run starts empty. It does not read or
write `~/.blue-agent/tasks.json`; nothing shipped does.

The 5% figure the commands print is arithmetic on the ledger, not a fee anyone collects.

## Hard rules

1. **Two live chains — say which one, every time.** Base (8453) is primary; Robinhood
   Chain (4663) carries the `rh-*` tools and the RWA registry. A ticker can exist on
   both, so a ticker string never identifies a token — chain + address does.
2. **All AI calls go through Virtuals.** `apps/web/src/app/api/_lib/llm.ts` → `callLLM()`.
   No direct OpenAI, Anthropic, Bankr, or Venice calls.
3. **Never invent contract addresses.** If an address is needed and not in the codebase, flag it.
4. **Business logic in packages, not in apps.** Keep `apps/web` thin.
