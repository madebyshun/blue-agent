# x402 Escrow Patterns — Blue Agent Grounding

Grounding for `blue build`, `blue audit`, `blue validate`, and `blue chat`.

This file is the authoritative reference for escrow design, implementation, and correctness on the Blue Agent marketplace. All escrow logic — for microtasks and gig tasks — runs on Base (chain ID 8453) using native USDC (`0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913`). Platform fee: 5%. Storage: `~/.blue-agent/microtasks.json`, `~/.blue-agent/microclaims.json`.

Use this file whenever you are writing, reviewing, or auditing escrow flows. Do not skip sections marked "Critical."

## 1. Title + Purpose

**What this file covers:**

1. What escrow means in the x402 / Blue Agent context (not smart contract escrow — simulated offchain escrow backed by USDC)
2. The complete escrow lifecycle — hold, active, release, refund, expire
3. Differences between microtask escrow and gig escrow
4. Idempotency — why it matters, how to implement it correctly
5. State machine design to prevent double-release and double-refund bugs
6. Partial payouts for multi-slot microtasks
7. Fee calculation — gross, net, platform cut
8. Failure modes and retry strategies
9. Worker/job integration with escrow state
10. Tradeoffs, best practices, common mistakes
11. Blue Agent CLI integration patterns

**Why this matters:**

Blue Agent's marketplace handles real USDC on Base. A double-release bug sends two payments. A double-refund bug returns more than was locked. Missing idempotency keys cause duplicate payouts on network retry. These are not theoretical risks — they are the most common class of bugs in escrow systems. This document gives you the patterns to avoid them.

**Scope:**

- Microtasks: $0.10–$20, multi-slot, USDC on Base, stored in `~/.blue-agent/microtasks.json`
- Gig tasks: $20+, single-claim, USDC on Base, stored in `~/.blue-agent/tasks.json`
- Platform fee: 5% of gross reward on every release
- Treasury: `0xf31f59e7b8b58555f7871f71993a394c8f1bffe5` (Base)
- USDC: `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` (Base, 6 decimals)

## 2. Core Concepts — What Escrow Means in the x402 Context

### 2.1 Offchain Simulated Escrow

Blue Agent's current escrow is **not a smart contract**. It is a state-tracked offchain system:

- When a task is posted, the creator's USDC balance is checked and the amount is "held" by recording it in the task's `escrow` object
- The funds are tracked in JSON storage (`microtasks.json`, `tasks.json`)
- Releases and refunds are recorded as state mutations in storage
- The actual USDC transfer (payout) is a separate operation — simulated now, to be replaced by a real `transferWithAuthorization` call to Base

This distinction is critical for auditing: the escrow state can diverge from actual USDC balances if the payout call fails after the state is updated, or if the state is updated twice. See Section 9 (Failure Modes) for mitigation.

### 2.2 Escrow Fields

Every task (micro and gig) carries an `escrow` object:

```typescript
interface EscrowLedger {
  amount_total:    number;  // Total USDC locked when task was created (gross)
  amount_locked:   number;  // Remaining USDC not yet released or refunded
  amount_released: number;  // Sum of all released amounts (gross, before fee)
  amount_refunded: number;  // Sum of all refunded amounts
  tx_hash?:        string;  // Optional: deposit or last payout tx hash
  status:          EscrowStatus;
}

type EscrowStatus = "pending" | "funded" | "released" | "refunded";
```

**Invariant (must always hold):**

```
amount_locked + amount_released + amount_refunded === amount_total
```

Any code that touches escrow fields must maintain this invariant. Violating it indicates a bug.

### 2.3 The Role of x402 in Escrow

x402 (`transferWithAuthorization`, EIP-3009) is used for the **payout step** — when a worker is paid. The creator signs a payment authorization off-chain; the system submits it on-chain at approval time. This means:

- The creator does NOT need gas to authorize payment
- The platform submits the transfer (and pays gas on behalf of the flow)
- The transfer is atomic: either it succeeds and the worker is paid, or it reverts and no USDC moves

For the hold step (escrow creation), x402 can also be used: the creator signs a `transferWithAuthorization` to a platform treasury at task creation time, locking funds. In the current implementation, this is simulated; in production it becomes a real on-chain transfer.

### 2.4 USDC Decimal Precision

USDC has 6 decimal places. $1.00 = `1_000_000` (1e6 units).

```typescript
const USDC_DECIMALS = 6;
const USDC_SCALE = 10 ** USDC_DECIMALS; // 1_000_000

// Convert display USDC to raw units
function toRaw(usdc: number): bigint {
  return BigInt(Math.round(usdc * USDC_SCALE));
}

// Convert raw units to display USDC
function toDisplay(raw: bigint): number {
  return Number(raw) / USDC_SCALE;
}

// Example:
// $1.50 USDC → 1_500_000 raw units
// $0.05 fee  →    50_000 raw units
```

Always work in raw units (bigint) for on-chain calls. Use display values (number, 2 decimal places) for UI output only. Never mix them.

resolved. escrow.status transitions to "released" or "refunded"
only when amount_locked reaches 0.
```

### 3.2 Hold (escrow creation)

Triggered when the creator runs `blue hire` or `blue micro post`.

Steps:
1. Validate reward amount is positive and within tier limits
2. Calculate total escrow amount: `reward_per_slot × slots_total` (microtask) or `reward` (gig)
3. Verify creator has sufficient USDC balance on Base
4. Record escrow: `amount_total = amount_locked = total`, `amount_released = 0`, `amount_refunded = 0`, `status = "funded"`
5. In production: submit `transferWithAuthorization` from creator to treasury
6. Store `tx_hash` of the deposit transaction

**Critical:** Do not set `status = "funded"` until the deposit is confirmed on-chain. In simulated mode, this confirmation is implicit. In production, wait for the tx receipt before updating state.

### 3.3 Active (task in progress)

When a worker accepts a task slot:
- Task status moves to `"in_progress"` (gig) or `"active"` (microtask)
- Escrow status stays `"funded"` — funds remain locked, not yet committed to worker
- The slot is reserved: `slots_filled++`, `slots_remaining--`

No escrow mutation happens at accept time. The lock is implicit in the funded state.

### 3.4 Release (approval)

Triggered when the poster runs `blue approve` or `blue micro approve`.

Steps:
1. Load task from storage
2. **Check escrow.status === "funded"** — if not, abort (Critical guard)
3. **Check idempotency key** — if this claim was already paid, abort (see Section 5)
4. Calculate gross, fee, net
5. Mutate escrow: `amount_released += gross`, `amount_locked -= gross`
6. If `amount_locked <= 0`: set `escrow.status = "released"`
7. Persist task to storage
8. Submit payout: `transferWithAuthorization(from=treasury, to=worker, value=net_raw)`
9. Submit fee: `transferWithAuthorization(from=treasury, to=treasury_fee_wallet, value=fee_raw)`
10. Store `payout_tx` on the claim record
11. Mark claim `status = "approved"`

**Critical:** Steps 7 and 8 must be atomic or idempotent. If payout fails after state is written, the system must detect and retry — not re-attempt after re-reading stale state.

### 3.5 Refund (rejection)

Triggered when poster rejects a submission or slot is abandoned.

Steps:
1. Load task from storage
2. **Check escrow.status === "funded"** — if not, abort
3. **Check claim.status === "submitted"** — do not refund already-resolved claims
4. Mutate escrow: `amount_refunded += reward_per_slot`, `amount_locked -= reward_per_slot`
5. If `amount_locked <= 0`: set `escrow.status = "refunded"`
6. Reopen slot: `slots_filled--`, `slots_remaining++`
7. Persist task to storage
8. Mark claim `status = "rejected"`
9. In production: transfer refund USDC back to creator

### 3.6 Expire (deadline passed, no submission)

Triggered by a background job (cron or worker) after `task.deadline`.

Steps:
1. Find all tasks where `deadline < now` and `escrow.status === "funded"`
2. For each unfilled or unresolved slot: refund `reward_per_slot` to creator
3. Mutate escrow identically to rejection flow
4. Set `task.status = "expired"`
5. Record expiry timestamp

## 4. Microtask Escrow vs Gig Escrow

### 4.1 Summary Comparison

| Dimension          | Microtask                         | Gig                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Reward range       | $0.10–$20 per slot                | $20+ (single reward)             |
| Slots              | 1–N (multi-slot)                  | 1 (single claim)                 |
| Escrow total       | `reward_per_slot × slots_total`   | `reward` (single amount)         |
| Partial releases   | Yes — each slot released on approve | No — one release on approve   |
| Status transitions | `open → active → submitted → approved/rejected/expired` | `open → in_progress → completed/disputed` |
| Approval modes     | `auto`, `manual`, `hybrid`        | Always manual                    |
| Storage file       | `microtasks.json`, `microclaims.json` | `tasks.json`                 |
| Escrow status      | Stays "funded" until all slots resolved | Transitions to "released" on single approval |
| CLI commands       | `blue micro post`, `blue micro approve` | `blue hire`, `blue approve`  |

### 4.2 Microtask Slot Mechanics

A microtask with 10 slots at $1 each holds $10 in escrow.

```
amount_total:    $10.00
amount_locked:   $10.00
amount_released: $0.00
amount_refunded: $0.00
status:          "funded"
```

After slot 1 is approved ($1 gross → $0.95 net to worker, $0.05 fee):

```
amount_total:    $10.00
amount_locked:    $9.00   ← decreased by $1 (gross slot amount)
amount_released:  $1.00   ← tracks gross released (before fee)
amount_refunded:  $0.00
status:          "funded"  ← still funded, more slots remain
```

After all 10 slots approved:

```
amount_total:    $10.00
amount_locked:    $0.00
amount_released: $10.00
amount_refunded:  $0.00
status:          "released"  ← transitions when locked reaches 0
```

After 8 slots approved, 2 slots rejected/expired:

```
amount_total:    $10.00
amount_locked:    $0.00
amount_released:  $8.00
amount_refunded:  $2.00
status:          "refunded"  ← last lock-clearing event was a refund
```

**Note on status semantics:** When the last slot is a release, status becomes `"released"`. When the last slot is a refund, status becomes `"refunded"`. Both are terminal states when `amount_locked === 0`. This is correct behavior.

### 4.3 Gig Escrow Mechanics

Gig tasks hold the full reward in a single escrow block. No slots.

```typescript
// Gig task escrow at creation
const escrow = {
  amount_total:    200.00,
  amount_locked:   200.00,
  amount_released: 0,
  amount_refunded: 0,
  status: "funded" as EscrowStatus,
};

// After approval
const gross = 200.00;
const fee   =   10.00;  // 5%
const net   =  190.00;

// Escrow after release
const updatedEscrow = {
  amount_total:    200.00,
  amount_locked:     0.00,
  amount_released: 200.00,
  amount_refunded:   0.00,
  status: "released" as EscrowStatus,
};
```

### 4.4 Approval Modes (Microtask Only)

```typescript
type MicroApproval = "auto" | "manual" | "hybrid";
```

- **auto** — submission is auto-approved immediately on `blue micro submit`. No poster review. Payout fires instantly. Use for objective, verifiable proofs (e.g., tweet reply with specific text).
- **manual** — poster must run `blue micro approve <taskId>`. Use for subjective proofs (screenshots, designs, written content).
- **hybrid** — first N slots auto-approved, then manual review kicks in. Use when you want fast early fill but quality control at scale.

Auto-approval is higher risk for fraud. Only use when the proof is machine-verifiable (tweet ID, on-chain tx, structured URL).

---

## 5. Idempotency — Keys, Processed Flags, Safe Retries

### 5.1 Why Idempotency Matters

Without idempotency protection, any of the following cause double payment:

- Network timeout on the payout call → client retries → two payouts
- Storage write succeeds but the caller crashes → on restart, reads "submitted" and pays again
- Race condition: two approve calls fire concurrently for the same claim

The fix is to make every payout operation idempotent: executing it twice produces the same result as executing it once.

### 5.2 Idempotency Key Generation

```typescript
import crypto from "crypto";

/**
 * Generate a deterministic idempotency key for an escrow payout.
 * Same task + claim always produces the same key.
 * Key is stable across restarts — based on IDs, not timestamps.
 */
function generateIdempotencyKey(taskId: string, claimId: string, operation: "release" | "refund"): string {
  const raw = `${operation}:${taskId}:${claimId}`;
  return crypto.createHash("sha256").update(raw).digest("hex");
}

// Examples:
// generateIdempotencyKey("micro_abc123", "claim_def456", "release")
// → "8f3a2b1c..." (deterministic, always the same for this pair)

// generateIdempotencyKey("task_abc123", "claim_def456", "refund")
// → "9e1d3f2a..." (different operation = different key)
```

### 5.3 Processed Flag Pattern

Add a `processed` flag to claim records. This is the primary idempotency guard.

```typescript
interface MicroClaim {
  id:               string;
  task_id:          string;
  claimant_address: string;
  claimant_handle:  string;
  accepted_at:      string;
  submitted_at?:    string;
  proof?:           string;
  proof_note?:      string;
  status:           MicroClaimStatus;  // "accepted" | "submitted" | "approved" | "rejected" | "expired"
  payout_tx?:       string;
  payout_processed: boolean;            // ← idempotency flag: true once payout is finalized
  idempotency_key?: string;             // ← stored key for audit trail
}
```

**Usage:**

```typescript
// In the approve function — check BEFORE doing any payout work
function releaseClaim(taskId: string, claimId: string): void {
  const claim = getClaim(claimId);
  if (!claim) throw new Error(`Claim ${claimId} not found`);

  // Idempotency guard — primary check
  if (claim.payout_processed) {
    console.warn(`[escrow] Claim ${claimId} already processed — skipping duplicate release`);
    return;  // Safe no-op
  }

  // Secondary status check
  if (claim.status === "approved") {
    console.warn(`[escrow] Claim ${claimId} already approved — skipping`);
    return;
  }

  if (claim.status !== "submitted") {
    throw new Error(`Cannot release claim ${claimId} in status "${claim.status}"`);
  }

  // Proceed with payout...
  const key = generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, claimId, "release");
  // ... submit payout using key as x402 nonce or memo
  // ... on success:
  claim.payout_processed = true;
  claim.idempotency_key = key;
  claim.status = "approved";
  upsertClaim(claim);
}
```

### 5.4 Safe Retry Pattern

When a payout call fails (network error, RPC timeout), the system must retry safely:

```typescript
async function releaseWithRetry(
  taskId: string,
  claimId: string,
  maxAttempts = 3,
  delayMs = 2000
): Promise<string> {  // returns tx hash
  const key = generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, claimId, "release");

  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    try {
      // Pass idempotency key as nonce to x402 transferWithAuthorization
      // If this was already submitted with the same key, the chain will reject the replay
      // (EIP-3009 nonces are single-use — same nonce = replay protection)
      const txHash = await submitPayoutTransfer(taskId, claimId, key);
      return txHash;
    } catch (err) {
      if (attempt === maxAttempts) throw err;
      console.warn(`[escrow] Payout attempt ${attempt} failed: ${err}. Retrying in ${delayMs}ms...`);
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, delayMs * attempt));  // exponential backoff
    }
  }
  throw new Error("Unreachable");
}
```

**Key insight:** The idempotency key doubles as the EIP-3009 nonce. Because EIP-3009 nonces are single-use on the USDC contract, submitting the same nonce twice will fail on-chain. This means even if your application retries, the chain prevents double-spend. Track the nonce locally too so you can detect "already submitted" vs "genuinely failed."

## 6. Avoiding Double Release / Double Refund — State Machine Design

### 6.1 Valid State Transitions (Claim)

```typescript
type MicroClaimStatus = "accepted" | "submitted" | "approved" | "rejected" | "expired";

// Valid transitions (from → to)
const VALID_CLAIM_TRANSITIONS: Record<MicroClaimStatus, MicroClaimStatus[]> = {
  accepted:  ["submitted", "expired"],          // accepted → submitted (normal), or expired (timeout)
  submitted: ["approved", "rejected", "expired"], // submitted → approved (payout), rejected (denial), expired (timeout)
  approved:  [],                                 // terminal — no further transitions
  rejected:  ["submitted"],                      // rejected → submitted (resubmit allowed)
  expired:   [],                                 // terminal — no further transitions
};

function assertValidClaimTransition(
  claimId: string,
  from: MicroClaimStatus,
  to: MicroClaimStatus
): void {
  const allowed = VALID_CLAIM_TRANSITIONS[from];
  if (!allowed.includes(to)) {
    throw new Error(
      `[escrow] Invalid claim transition for ${claimId}: "${from}" → "${to}". ` +
      `Allowed from "${from}": [${allowed.join(", ")}]`
    );
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Valid State Transitions (EscrowStatus)

```typescript
type EscrowStatus = "pending" | "funded" | "released" | "refunded";

// Valid escrow status transitions
const VALID_ESCROW_TRANSITIONS: Record<EscrowStatus, EscrowStatus[]> = {
  pending:  ["funded", "refunded"],  // funded on deposit, refunded if deposit fails
  funded:   ["released", "refunded", "funded"],  // "funded" to "funded" for partial multi-slot ops
  released: [],                      // terminal
  refunded: [],                      // terminal
};

function assertValidEscrowTransition(
  taskId: string,
  from: EscrowStatus,
  to: EscrowStatus
): void {
  const allowed = VALID_ESCROW_TRANSITIONS[from];
  if (!allowed.includes(to)) {
    throw new Error(
      `[escrow] Invalid escrow transition for ${taskId}: "${from}" → "${to}". ` +
      `Allowed from "${from}": [${allowed.join(", ")}]`
    );
  }
}
```

### 6.3 Full EscrowState Type and State Machine

```typescript
interface EscrowState {
  taskId:          string;
  status:          EscrowStatus;
  amount_total:    number;
  amount_locked:   number;
  amount_released: number;
  amount_refunded: number;
}

class EscrowStateMachine {
  private state: EscrowState;

  constructor(initial: EscrowState) {
    this.state = { ...initial };
    this.assertInvariant();
  }

  // Release one slot's gross amount
  releaseSlot(gross: number): EscrowState {
    if (this.state.status !== "funded") {
      throw new Error(
        `[escrow] Cannot release from status "${this.state.status}" for task ${this.state.taskId}`
      );
    }
    if (gross > this.state.amount_locked + 0.000001) {  // epsilon for float precision
      throw new Error(
        `[escrow] Release amount $${gross} exceeds locked $${this.state.amount_locked}`
      );
    }

    this.state = {
      ...this.state,
      amount_released: this.state.amount_released + gross,
      amount_locked:   Math.max(0, this.state.amount_locked - gross),
    };

    if (this.state.amount_locked <= 0.000001) {
      assertValidEscrowTransition(this.state.taskId, this.state.status, "released");
      this.state.status = "released";
    }

    this.assertInvariant();
    return { ...this.state };
  }

  // Refund one slot's gross amount
  refundSlot(gross: number): EscrowState {
    if (this.state.status !== "funded") {
      throw new Error(
        `[escrow] Cannot refund from status "${this.state.status}" for task ${this.state.taskId}`
      );
    }
    if (gross > this.state.amount_locked + 0.000001) {
      throw new Error(
        `[escrow] Refund amount $${gross} exceeds locked $${this.state.amount_locked}`
      );
    }

    this.state = {
      ...this.state,
      amount_refunded: this.state.amount_refunded + gross,
      amount_locked:   Math.max(0, this.state.amount_locked - gross),
    };

    if (this.state.amount_locked <= 0.000001) {
      assertValidEscrowTransition(this.state.taskId, this.state.status, "refunded");
      this.state.status = "refunded";
    }

    this.assertInvariant();
    return { ...this.state };
  }

  getState(): Readonly<EscrowState> {
    return { ...this.state };
  }

  // Invariant: released + refunded + locked === total (within float epsilon)
  private assertInvariant(): void {
    const sum = this.state.amount_released + this.state.amount_refunded + this.state.amount_locked;
    const delta = Math.abs(sum - this.state.amount_total);
    if (delta > 0.0001) {
      throw new Error(
        `[escrow] INVARIANT VIOLATION for task ${this.state.taskId}: ` +
        `released(${this.state.amount_released}) + refunded(${this.state.amount_refunded}) + ` +
        `locked(${this.state.amount_locked}) = ${sum} ≠ total(${this.state.amount_total})`
      );
    }
  }
}
```

### 6.4 Guard Pattern — Always Check Before Acting

```typescript
// Every approve/refund operation must start with these guards

function guardRelease(task: MicroTask, claim: MicroClaim): void {

  // Guard 4: amount_locked must cover the payout
  if (task.escrow.amount_locked < task.reward_per_slot - 0.000001) {

}

function guardRefund(task: MicroTask, claim: MicroClaim): void {

      `[escrow] Claim ${claim.id} status is "${claim.status}" — cannot refund. ` +
      `Only "submitted" or "accepted" claims can be refunded.`
    );
  }
  if (claim.payout_processed) {
    throw new Error(
      `[escrow] Claim ${claim.id} was already processed — refusing refund.`
    );
  }
}
```

## 7. Partial Payouts (Multi-Slot Microtasks)

### 7.1 Slot-by-Slot Release Logic

Multi-slot tasks pay out incrementally. Each slot approval releases exactly `reward_per_slot` from the locked pool.

```typescript
interface SlotPayoutResult {
  gross:         number;  // reward_per_slot
  fee:           number;  // gross × 0.05
  net:           number;  // gross × 0.95 — amount sent to worker
  updatedEscrow: EscrowLedger;
  taskComplete:  boolean;
}

function releaseSlotPayout(
  task: MicroTask,
  claim: MicroClaim,
  allClaims: MicroClaim[]
): SlotPayoutResult {
  const sm = new EscrowStateMachine({
    taskId:          task.id,
    status:          task.escrow.status,
    amount_total:    task.escrow.amount_total,
    amount_locked:   task.escrow.amount_locked,
    amount_released: task.escrow.amount_released,
    amount_refunded: task.escrow.amount_refunded,
  });

  const gross = task.reward_per_slot;
  const { fee, net } = calculateFee(gross);

  // Guards (see Section 6.4)
  guardRelease(task, claim);

  // Mutate state machine
  const updatedState = sm.releaseSlot(gross);

  // Check if all slots resolved after this release
  const resolvedClaims = allClaims.filter(
    (c) => c.task_id === task.id && (c.status === "approved" || c.id === claim.id)
  );
  const taskComplete = resolvedClaims.length >= task.slots_total;

  return {
    gross,
    fee,
    net,
    updatedEscrow: {
      amount_total:    updatedState.amount_total,
      amount_locked:   updatedState.amount_locked,
      amount_released: updatedState.amount_released,
      amount_refunded: updatedState.amount_refunded,
      status:          updatedState.status,
      tx_hash:         task.escrow.tx_hash,
    },
    taskComplete,
  };
}
```

### 7.2 Partial Completion Accounting

When a task has mixed outcomes (some approved, some rejected, some expired):

```typescript
function computeEscrowSummary(task: MicroTask, claims: MicroClaim[]): {
  totalPaidOut:  number;
  totalRefunded: number;
  totalFees:     number;
  pendingSlots:  number;
} {
  const taskClaims = claims.filter((c) => c.task_id === task.id);

  const approved = taskClaims.filter((c) => c.status === "approved");
  const refunded = taskClaims.filter((c) => c.status === "rejected" || c.status === "expired");

  const gross       = approved.length * task.reward_per_slot;
  const totalFees   = gross * 0.05;
  const totalPaidOut = gross - totalFees;

  const totalRefunded = refunded.length * task.reward_per_slot;

  // Slots with no claim or still accepted/submitted
  const pendingSlots = task.slots_total
    - approved.length
    - refunded.length
    - taskClaims.filter((c) => c.status === "submitted").length;

  return { totalPaidOut, totalRefunded, totalFees, pendingSlots };
}
```

### 7.3 Concurrent Slot Approval Safety

When multiple slot approvals happen in quick succession (e.g., auto-approve mode with many simultaneous submissions), you must serialize escrow mutations. Do not run concurrent writes to the same task's escrow.

```typescript
// Naive approach — UNSAFE for concurrent approvals
async function approveAll(taskId: string): Promise<void> {
  const claims = getClaimsForTask(taskId).filter((c) => c.status === "submitted");
  await Promise.all(claims.map((c) => approveOne(taskId, c.id)));  // ❌ race condition
}

// Safe approach — serialize
async function approveAll(taskId: string): Promise<void> {
  const claims = getClaimsForTask(taskId).filter((c) => c.status === "submitted");
  for (const claim of claims) {
    await approveOne(taskId, claim.id);  // ✅ sequential, each reads fresh state
  }
}
```

## 8. Fee Calculation — Platform 5% Fee, Net vs Gross

### 8.1 The Formula

```
gross = reward_per_slot  (what was locked in escrow per slot)
fee   = gross × 0.05     (5% platform fee — goes to treasury)
net   = gross × 0.95     (what the worker receives)
```

### 8.2 Fee Calculation Function

```typescript
const PLATFORM_FEE_PCT = 0.05;  // 5%

interface FeeBreakdown {
  gross: number;  // Total slot reward (USDC, display)
  fee:   number;  // Platform fee (5%)
  net:   number;  // Worker payout (95%)
  grossRaw: bigint;  // Raw USDC units (6 decimals) for on-chain call
  feeRaw:   bigint;
  netRaw:   bigint;
}

function calculateFee(grossUsdc: number): FeeBreakdown {
  // Work in integer arithmetic to avoid float rounding errors
  const SCALE = 1_000_000;  // USDC has 6 decimals

  const grossRaw = BigInt(Math.round(grossUsdc * SCALE));

  // Fee: floor (round down — favor worker, not platform)
  const feeRaw = grossRaw * 5n / 100n;

  // Net: gross minus fee (exact, no rounding error)
  const netRaw = grossRaw - feeRaw;

  return {
    gross: Number(grossRaw) / SCALE,
    fee:   Number(feeRaw)   / SCALE,
    net:   Number(netRaw)   / SCALE,
    grossRaw,
    feeRaw,
    netRaw,
  };
}

// Examples:
// calculateFee(1.00) → { gross: 1.00, fee: 0.05, net: 0.95 }
// calculateFee(5.00) → { gross: 5.00, fee: 0.25, net: 4.75 }
// calculateFee(20.00) → { gross: 20.00, fee: 1.00, net: 19.00 }
// calculateFee(0.10) → { gross: 0.10, fee: 0.005, net: 0.095 }
//   → 0.10 USDC = 100_000 raw; fee = 100_000 × 5 / 100 = 5_000 = $0.005
```

### 8.3 Fee Distribution

Platform fee goes to:
- Treasury: `0xf31f59e7b8b58555f7871f71993a394c8f1bffe5` (Base)

Worker net goes to:
- Worker's wallet address (resolved from `claimant_address`)

In the current simulated implementation, both transfers are logged but not submitted on-chain. In production, both use `transferWithAuthorization` from the escrow treasury.

### 8.4 Why Fee Math Must Live in One Place

The fee calculation must exist in exactly one function, imported everywhere it is used.

```
❌ BAD:
  In approve.ts:  const fee = gross * 0.05;
  In storage.ts:  const net = amount / 1.05;  ← different formula, wrong result
  In submit.ts:   const fee = Math.floor(gross * 5 / 100);  ← different rounding

✅ GOOD:
  export { calculateFee } from "./escrow";
  // imported in approve.ts, storage.ts, submit.ts — one formula, one rounding rule
```

If fee logic is scattered, any change to fee percentage (e.g., 5% → 3%) requires hunting down every occurrence. Centralizing also makes auditing trivial.

### 8.5 Amount Verification

Never trust the client for the escrow amount. The gross amount used for fee calculation must come from the stored task record, not from the request/input.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — trusting client input for amount
function approveClaimUnsafe(taskId: string, claimId: string, clientAmount: number) {
  const { fee, net } = calculateFee(clientAmount);  // client could send $0.01 instead of $5.00
  // ...
}

// ✅ CORRECT — always read amount from storage
function approveClaimSafe(taskId: string, claimId: string) {
  const task = getTask(taskId);
  if (!task) throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} not found`);
  const { fee, net } = calculateFee(task.reward_per_slot);  // authoritative value from storage
  // ...
}
```

## 9. Failure Modes and Retries

### 9.1 Failure Mode Taxonomy

| Mode | Description | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------|------------|
| Network timeout on payout | Payout tx submitted but no confirmation received | Double payment on retry | Idempotency key (Section 5) |
| Storage write after payout | Payout sent, then storage update crashes | Escrow state inconsistent with actual balance | Write-then-pay order (see 9.2) |
| Concurrent approve calls | Two processes approve the same claim simultaneously | Double payment | Serialization, processed flag |
| RPC node failure | On-chain call returns error | Payout not sent, state written as "approved" | Retry queue with key |
| Partial multi-slot failure | 7 of 10 slot payouts succeed, 3 fail | Inconsistent escrow state | Per-slot idempotency keys |
| Deadline expiry race | Expiry job fires while manual approval is in flight | Refund after payout | Status check in expiry job |
| Storage corruption | JSON parse fails | All tasks lost | Regular backups, validate on read |

### 9.2 Write-Then-Pay vs Pay-Then-Write

**Pay-then-write** order:
1. Submit payout to chain
2. Update storage

Risk: If step 2 fails, payout was sent but storage still shows "submitted". On retry, system sees "submitted" and pays again.

**Write-then-pay** order:
1. Update storage (mark as "pending_payout")
2. Submit payout to chain
3. On success: update storage to "approved" + `payout_tx`
4. On failure: revert storage to "submitted" OR leave as "pending_payout" and queue retry

Recommendation: Use **write-then-pay with a pending state**:

```typescript
type MicroClaimStatus =
  | "accepted"
  | "submitted"
  | "pending_payout"  // ← intermediate state: being processed
  | "approved"
  | "rejected"
  | "expired";

async function approveClaim(taskId: string, claimId: string): Promise<void> {
  const claim = getClaim(claimId);
  if (!claim) throw new Error(`Claim ${claimId} not found`);

  // Guard (idempotency)
  if (claim.payout_processed || claim.status === "approved") {
    console.warn(`[escrow] Claim ${claimId} already processed`);
    return;
  }

  // 1. Mark as pending (prevents concurrent approval)
  claim.status = "pending_payout";
  upsertClaim(claim);

  try {
    // 2. Calculate amounts
    const task = getTask(taskId)!;
    const { fee, net, netRaw, feeRaw } = calculateFee(task.reward_per_slot);

    // 3. Submit payout (x402 transferWithAuthorization)
    const payoutTx = await submitUSDCTransfer({
      to: claim.claimant_address,
      amount: netRaw,
      nonce: generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, claimId, "release"),
    });

    // 4. Submit fee transfer
    await submitUSDCTransfer({
      to: TREASURY_ADDRESS,
      amount: feeRaw,
      nonce: generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, claimId, "fee"),
    });

    // 5. Update escrow state
    const updatedTask = releaseSlotFromTask(task, claim);
    upsertTask(updatedTask);

    // 6. Finalize claim
    claim.status = "approved";
    claim.payout_tx = payoutTx;
    claim.payout_processed = true;
    upsertClaim(claim);

  } catch (err) {
    // On failure: revert to submitted so it can be retried
    claim.status = "submitted";
    upsertClaim(claim);
    throw err;
  }
}
```

### 9.3 Expiry Collision Guard

```typescript
async function expireStaleSlot(task: MicroTask, claim: MicroClaim): Promise<void> {
  // Re-read claim from storage immediately before acting
  // to guard against a manual approval that happened between the expiry
  // job's load and this function call
  const freshClaim = getClaim(claim.id);
  if (!freshClaim) return;

  // Skip if claim was already resolved
  if (["approved", "rejected", "expired"].includes(freshClaim.status)) {
    console.log(`[expiry] Claim ${claim.id} already resolved (${freshClaim.status}) — skipping`);
    return;
  }

  // Safe to refund
  const updatedTask = refundSlotFromTask(task, freshClaim);
  freshClaim.status = "expired";
  upsertTask(updatedTask);
  upsertClaim(freshClaim);
}
```

### 9.4 Storage Health Check

Run on startup to detect invariant violations before they cause financial errors:

```typescript
function validateEscrowHealth(): { valid: boolean; errors: string[] } {
  const tasks = loadTasks();
  const errors: string[] = [];

  for (const task of tasks) {
    const e = task.escrow;
    const sum = e.amount_released + e.amount_refunded + e.amount_locked;
    const delta = Math.abs(sum - e.amount_total);

    if (delta > 0.0001) {
      errors.push(
        `Task ${task.id}: escrow invariant violated. ` +
        `released(${e.amount_released}) + refunded(${e.amount_refunded}) + locked(${e.amount_locked}) = ${sum} ≠ total(${e.amount_total})`
      );
    }

    if (!["pending", "funded", "released", "refunded"].includes(e.status)) {
      errors.push(`Task ${task.id}: invalid escrow status "${e.status}"`);
    }
  }

  return { valid: errors.length === 0, errors };
}
```

## 10. Worker Job Integration — How Jobs Interact with Escrow State

### 10.1 Job → Escrow Event Mapping

| Worker Action | CLI Command | Escrow Effect |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Worker accepts task | `blue micro accept <taskId>` | None — slots_filled++, no escrow mutation |
| Worker submits proof | `blue micro submit <taskId>` | Claim moves to "submitted", no escrow mutation yet |
| Poster approves | `blue micro approve <taskId>` | releaseSlot() called, payout fires |
| Poster rejects | `blue micro approve <taskId> --reject` | refundSlot() called, slot reopened |
| Auto-approve fires | (internal, triggered by submit in auto mode) | releaseSlot() called immediately |
| Deadline passes | (background job) | expireStaleSlot() for all open/accepted slots |
| Task cancelled | (future: blue micro cancel) | refundSlot() for all unfilled slots |

### 10.2 Job State Machine (Worker Perspective)

```
Worker lifecycle:

  [no claim]
      │
      │ blue micro accept <taskId> @handle
      ▼
  [accepted]   claim.status = "accepted", slot reserved
      │
      │ blue micro submit <taskId> @handle <proof>
      ▼
  [submitted]  claim.status = "submitted", escrow untouched
      │
      ├──── Poster approves ──────▶ [approved] — payout sent
      │
      ├──── Poster rejects ──────▶ [rejected] — slot refunded to creator
      │                                        — slot reopened for new worker
      │
      └──── Deadline passes ─────▶ [expired]  — slot refunded to creator
```

### 10.3 Escrow Queries from Job Context

Jobs should query escrow state before acting. Never assume state from prior context.

```typescript
function getEscrowSnapshot(taskId: string): {
  status: EscrowStatus;
  remainingLocked: number;
  releasedCount: number;
  refundedCount: number;
} {
  const task = getTask(taskId);
  if (!task) throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} not found`);

  const claims = getClaimsForTask(taskId);
  const releasedCount = claims.filter((c) => c.status === "approved").length;
  const refundedCount = claims.filter((c) => c.status === "rejected" || c.status === "expired").length;

  return {
    status:          task.escrow.status,
    remainingLocked: task.escrow.amount_locked,
    releasedCount,
    refundedCount,
  };
}
```

### 10.4 Gig Task Approve with Full Escrow Release

```typescript
async function approveGigTask(taskId: string): Promise<void> {
  const tasks = loadAllTasks();
  const idx = tasks.findIndex((t) => t.id === taskId);
  if (idx < 0) throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} not found`);

  const task = tasks[idx];

  // Guard: must be in_progress
  if (task.status !== "in_progress") {
    throw new Error(
      `Task ${taskId} status is "${task.status}" — cannot approve. Must be "in_progress".`
    );
  }

  // Guard: escrow must be funded
  if (task.escrow.status !== "funded") {
    throw new Error(
      `Task ${taskId} escrow status is "${task.escrow.status}" — cannot release. Must be "funded".`
    );
  }

  // Guard: doer must exist
  if (!task.doer) {
    throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} has no doer assigned`);
  }

  // Fee calculation
  const { gross, fee, net, grossRaw, feeRaw, netRaw } = calculateFee(task.reward);

  // Submit payout (x402)
  const payoutTx = await submitUSDCTransfer({
    to: task.doer_address,
    amount: netRaw,
    nonce: generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, task.doer, "release"),
  });

  // Update task
  tasks[idx] = {
    ...task,
    status: "completed",
    escrow: {
      ...task.escrow,
      amount_released: gross,
      amount_locked:   0,
      status:          "released",
    },
    payout_tx: payoutTx,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  };

  saveAllTasks(tasks);

  console.log(`[approve] Task ${taskId} approved. Net: $${net.toFixed(2)}, Fee: $${fee.toFixed(2)}, Tx: ${payoutTx}`);
}
```

### 10.5 Refund on Rejection

```typescript
async function rejectGigTask(taskId: string): Promise<void> {
  const tasks = loadAllTasks();
  const idx = tasks.findIndex((t) => t.id === taskId);
  if (idx < 0) throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} not found`);

  const task = tasks[idx];

  if (task.status !== "in_progress") {
    throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} cannot be rejected from status "${task.status}"`);
  }
  if (task.escrow.status !== "funded") {
    throw new Error(`Task ${taskId} escrow is "${task.escrow.status}" — cannot refund`);
  }

  // Refund full amount to creator
  const refundTx = await submitUSDCTransfer({
    to: task.poster_address,
    amount: BigInt(Math.round(task.reward * 1_000_000)),
    nonce: generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, task.poster, "refund"),
  });

  tasks[idx] = {
    ...task,
    status: "open",  // reopen for another doer
    doer: undefined,
    escrow: {
      ...task.escrow,
      amount_refunded: task.reward,
      amount_locked:   0,
      status:          "refunded",
    },
    refund_tx: refundTx,
    updated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
  };

  saveAllTasks(tasks);
}
```

### 10.6 Refund on Expiry

```typescript
async function expireGigTask(taskId: string): Promise<void> {
  const task = getGigTask(taskId);
  if (!task) return;

  // Re-read to guard against race
  if (!["open", "in_progress"].includes(task.status)) return;
  if (task.escrow.status !== "funded") return;

  if (new Date(task.deadline) > new Date()) {
    return;  // Not expired yet — expiry job fired early
  }

  await rejectGigTask(taskId);  // Reuse refund logic
  // Then explicitly set status to "expired" not "open"
  const tasks = loadAllTasks();
  const idx = tasks.findIndex((t) => t.id === taskId);
  if (idx >= 0) {
    tasks[idx].status = "expired";
    saveAllTasks(tasks);
  }
}
```

## 11. Tradeoffs and Best Practices

### 11.1 Simulated vs On-Chain Escrow

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Simulated (current) | Fast, no gas, easy dev/test | Funds not actually locked, trust-based |
| On-chain contract | Truly trustless, auditable | Gas cost, deployment overhead, upgrade complexity |
| Hybrid (treasury hold) | Treasury holds USDC, no custom contract | Requires treasury to be trusted, semi-centralized |

The current Blue Agent approach is **simulated with treasury semantics**: escrow is tracked in JSON, payouts go via `transferWithAuthorization` from treasury wallet. This is the right tradeoff for launch. Migrate to a proper escrow contract once task volume justifies the gas overhead.

### 11.2 Float Precision — Always Use Integer Math

USDC has exactly 6 decimal places. JavaScript `number` (IEEE 754 double) loses precision on values like `0.1 * 7 = 0.7000000000000001`.

**Rule:** Convert to raw integer units (bigint) before any arithmetic that will be submitted on-chain. Use display floats only for terminal output.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — float arithmetic on currency
const fee = 1.50 * 0.05;  // 0.07500000000000001

// ✅ CORRECT — integer arithmetic
const grossRaw = 1_500_000n;  // $1.50 in USDC raw
const feeRaw = grossRaw * 5n / 100n;  // 75_000n = $0.075
const netRaw = grossRaw - feeRaw;    // 1_425_000n = $1.425

// Display only
const display = Number(netRaw) / 1_000_000;  // 1.425
```

### 11.3 Storage Atomicity

The current `fs.writeFileSync` approach is not atomic: a crash mid-write corrupts the JSON file.

**Production recommendation:** Use a write-then-rename pattern:

```typescript
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

function writeAtomic(filePath: string, data: string): void {
  const tmp = filePath + ".tmp";
  fs.writeFileSync(tmp, data, "utf8");
  fs.renameSync(tmp, filePath);
  // rename is atomic on POSIX — either the old file or new file is visible, never partial
}
```

### 11.4 Single Source of Truth for Task State

The task JSON file is the authoritative source. Never cache task state in memory across operations. Always re-read from storage before acting.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — stale in-memory task
const task = getTask(taskId);
await doSomething();  // time passes
releaseEscrow(task);  // task might have changed

// ✅ CORRECT — fresh read before every mutation
await doSomething();
const task = getTask(taskId);  // re-read immediately before use
releaseEscrow(task);
```

### 11.5 Fee Must Be Explicitly Tracked

Store `amount_released` as the **gross** amount (before fee), not the net. This makes it easy to verify:

```
amount_released (gross) × 0.95 = total sent to workers
amount_released (gross) × 0.05 = total sent to platform
```

If you store net in `amount_released`, you lose the ability to verify fee collection without cross-referencing claim records.

---

## 12. Common Mistakes / Red Flags

### 12.1 Releasing Without Checking Current Status

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — no status guard
function releaseBad(task: MicroTask, claim: MicroClaim) {
  task.escrow.amount_released += task.reward_per_slot;
  task.escrow.amount_locked -= task.reward_per_slot;
  // No check: what if escrow.status === "released"? What if claim.status === "approved"?
  upsertTask(task);
}

// ✅ CORRECT — always guard
function releaseGood(task: MicroTask, claim: MicroClaim) {
  if (task.escrow.status !== "funded") {
    throw new Error(`Cannot release — escrow is "${task.escrow.status}"`);
  }
  if (claim.status !== "submitted") {
    throw new Error(`Cannot release claim in status "${claim.status}"`);
  }
  if (claim.payout_processed) {
    throw new Error("Claim already paid — refusing duplicate release");
  }
  // ... proceed
}
```

**Why this matters:** A task that is already in status "released" or "refunded" has `amount_locked = 0`. Releasing without checking lets you decrement below zero, breaking the invariant and potentially sending extra funds.

### 12.2 Refunding After Payout Already Sent

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — refunding a claim that was already paid
async function processExpiredClaims(taskId: string) {
  const claims = getClaimsForTask(taskId);
  for (const claim of claims) {
    // Bug: does not check if claim was already approved/paid
    await refundClaim(taskId, claim.id);
  }
}

// ✅ CORRECT — skip resolved claims
async function processExpiredClaims(taskId: string) {
  const claims = getClaimsForTask(taskId);
  for (const claim of claims) {
    if (["approved", "rejected", "expired"].includes(claim.status)) {
      continue;  // Already resolved — skip
    }
    await refundClaim(taskId, claim.id);
  }
}
```

**Why this matters:** A claim that was approved has already triggered a payout. Refunding it additionally sends money back to the creator that should stay with the worker, or returns money that isn't locked anymore.

### 12.3 No Idempotency Key → Double Payment

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — no idempotency, unsafe on retry
async function payWorkerUnsafe(workerAddress: string, amount: bigint) {
  await sendUSDC(workerAddress, amount);  // No nonce, no idempotency key
  // If this is retried, worker is paid twice
}

// ✅ CORRECT — deterministic nonce prevents double payment
async function payWorkerSafe(taskId: string, claimId: string, workerAddress: string, amount: bigint) {
  const nonce = generateIdempotencyKey(taskId, claimId, "release");
  // nonce is deterministic — retrying with same taskId+claimId produces same nonce
  // EIP-3009 on USDC contract will reject replay of the same nonce
  await sendUSDCWithAuth(workerAddress, amount, nonce);
}
```

**Why this matters:** Without an idempotency key, any network retry (timeout, connection drop, server restart) fires a second payout. On the USDC contract, two authorizations with different nonces are both valid. Only a deterministic, stored nonce prevents this.

### 12.4 Trusting Client-Side State for Amount

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — amount comes from request body (client-controlled)
app.post("/approve", async (req, res) => {
  const { taskId, claimId, amount } = req.body;  // ← attacker sends amount=0.01
  const { net } = calculateFee(amount);           // → fee=0.0005, net=0.0095
  await sendUSDC(doerAddress, net);               // → worker underpaid
});

// ✅ CORRECT — amount always comes from storage
app.post("/approve", async (req, res) => {
  const { taskId, claimId } = req.body;
  const task = getTask(taskId);                   // authoritative source
  const { net } = calculateFee(task.reward_per_slot);  // correct amount
  await sendUSDC(doerAddress, net);
});
```

**Why this matters:** If any part of the amount calculation trusts client input, a malicious client can manipulate payment amounts. The authoritative reward amount must always come from storage, where it was set at task creation time by the creator.

### 12.5 Mixing Fee Math in Multiple Places

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — fee math spread across files
// In approve.ts:
const fee = gross * 0.05;
const net = gross - fee;

// In storage.ts escrowRelease():
task.escrow.amount_released += netAmount / (1 - PLATFORM_FEE);  // different formula

// In submit.ts (auto-approve):
const payout = reward * 95 / 100;  // yet another formula

// → When you change fee from 5% to 3%, you need to find and update all three.
// → If you miss one, payouts are wrong.

// ✅ CORRECT — single canonical function
// escrow-utils.ts
export const PLATFORM_FEE_PCT = 0.05;
export function calculateFee(gross: number): FeeBreakdown { ... }

// approve.ts, storage.ts, submit.ts all import from escrow-utils.ts
import { calculateFee } from "../escrow-utils";
```

**Why this matters:** Fee percentage changes (promotional periods, governance changes) require a single-line edit in one file, not a search-and-replace across the codebase. Scattered math also creates inconsistencies — different callers may round differently, causing `released + refunded ≠ total`.

### 12.6 Updating Task Status Without Updating Escrow (or Vice Versa)

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — task status updated, escrow not updated
task.status = "completed";
upsertTask(task);
// escrow.status is still "funded", escrow.amount_locked is still > 0

// ❌ WRONG — escrow updated, task status not updated
task.escrow.amount_locked = 0;
task.escrow.status = "released";
upsertTask(task);
// task.status is still "in_progress"

// ✅ CORRECT — always update both atomically in one upsert
task.status = "completed";
task.escrow.amount_released = task.reward;
task.escrow.amount_locked = 0;
task.escrow.status = "released";
task.updated_at = new Date().toISOString();
upsertTask(task);
```

### 12.7 Not Reopening Slots on Rejection

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — slot stays "filled" after rejection
claim.status = "rejected";
upsertClaim(claim);
// slots_remaining is unchanged — new workers cannot take this slot

// ✅ CORRECT — reopen the slot
claim.status = "rejected";
upsertClaim(claim);

task.slots_filled = Math.max(0, task.slots_filled - 1);
task.slots_remaining = Math.min(task.slots_total, task.slots_remaining + 1);
if (task.slots_remaining > 0 && !["completed", "expired", "cancelled"].includes(task.status)) {
  task.status = "active";  // or "open" if no current active claims
}
upsertTask(task);
```

## 13. Blue Agent CLI Integration Patterns

### 13.1 Command → Escrow Event Map

```bash
# POST MICROTASK — creates escrow, status becomes "funded"
blue micro post "record a 30s demo of your project" \
  --reward 1 \
  --slots 10 \
  --platform x \
  --proof video \
  --deadline 2026-05-25 \
  --approval manual

# Expected output includes:
#   Escrow: funded ($10.00 USDC)   ← amount_total = reward × slots

# POST GIG — creates escrow
blue hire "audit my ERC-20 contract for reentrancy" --reward 200

# Expected output includes:
#   Escrow: $200.00 USDC held

# ACCEPT — no escrow change, slot reservation only
blue micro accept micro_abc123 @workerhandle
blue accept task_abc123 @workerhandle

# SUBMIT PROOF — no escrow change, triggers review
blue micro submit micro_abc123 @workerhandle https://x.com/user/status/...
blue submit task_abc123 @workerhandle https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42

# APPROVE MICROTASK — triggers releaseSlot()
blue micro approve micro_abc123
# Expected output includes:
#   Gross:   $1.00
#   Fee:     $0.05 (5%)
#   Net:     $0.95
#   Escrow:  $9.00 remaining (if 9 slots still open)

# APPROVE WITH SPECIFIC CLAIM
blue micro approve micro_abc123 --claim claim_def456

# REJECT SUBMISSION — triggers refundSlot(), reopens slot
blue micro approve micro_abc123 --reject
# Expected output includes:
#   Slot reopened — 9 slot(s) available
#   Escrow: $1.00 refunded to creator

# APPROVE GIG — triggers full escrow release
blue approve task_abc123
# Expected output includes:
#   Gross:  $200.00
#   Fee:    $10.00 (5%)
#   Net:    $190.00
#   Escrow: released

# VALIDATE ESCROW HEALTH
blue validate escrow
# Runs validateEscrowHealth(), reports any invariant violations
```

### 13.2 Escrow Status in CLI Output

Every command that touches escrow should print the current escrow state in a consistent format:

```typescript
function printEscrowStatus(task: MicroTask | Task): void {
  const e = task.escrow;
  const pct = e.amount_total > 0
    ? Math.round((e.amount_released / e.amount_total) * 100)
    : 0;

  process.stdout.write(`  Escrow:\n`);
  process.stdout.write(`    Total:    $${e.amount_total.toFixed(2)}\n`);
  process.stdout.write(`    Locked:   $${e.amount_locked.toFixed(2)}\n`);
  process.stdout.write(`    Released: $${e.amount_released.toFixed(2)} (${pct}%)\n`);
  process.stdout.write(`    Refunded: $${e.amount_refunded.toFixed(2)}\n`);
  process.stdout.write(`    Status:   ${e.status}\n`);
}
```

### 13.3 Escrow Audit Command Pattern

`blue validate` should include an escrow audit subcommand:

```typescript
// packages/builder/src/commands/validate.ts

export async function runValidate(args: string[]): Promise<void> {
  const subcommand = args[0];

  if (subcommand === "escrow") {
    const { valid, errors } = validateEscrowHealth();
    if (valid) {
      process.stdout.write("  ✅ All escrow records are valid\n");
    } else {
      process.stdout.write(`  ❌ Found ${errors.length} escrow violation(s):\n\n`);
      for (const err of errors) {
        process.stdout.write(`  • ${err}\n`);
      }
      process.exit(1);
    }
    return;
  }

  // ... other validate subcommands
}
```

Usage:

```bash
blue validate escrow
# ✅ All escrow records are valid
# OR
# ❌ Found 1 escrow violation(s):
# • Task micro_abc123: escrow invariant violated. released(5.00) + refunded(2.00) + locked(4.00) = 11.00 ≠ total(10.00)
```

### 13.4 Integration with `blue build` Output

When `blue build` generates a marketplace task system, it must include these escrow patterns. The generated code should:

1. Import `calculateFee` from a single `escrow-utils.ts`
2. Define the `EscrowStateMachine` class or equivalent guard functions
3. Include idempotency key generation tied to task + claim IDs
4. Write escrow state atomically (write-then-rename pattern)
5. Log escrow mutations with timestamps for debugging

Example prompt fragment for `blue build`:

```
Task: Build a microtask marketplace on Base.
Requirements:
  - USDC escrow for task rewards
  - 5% platform fee on release
  - Multi-slot support (up to 50 slots per task)
  - Idempotent payout with EIP-3009 nonce
  - Escrow state: pending | funded | released | refunded
  - Invariant: amount_locked + amount_released + amount_refunded === amount_total
```

`blue build` should recognize this context and apply all patterns from this grounding file.

### 13.5 Integration with `blue audit` Checks

When auditing a task marketplace implementation, `blue audit` should flag:

```
CRITICAL:
  [ ] releaseEscrow() checks escrow.status === "funded" before releasing
  [ ] refundEscrow() checks claim.status !== "approved" before refunding
  [ ] payout_processed flag exists and is checked before every payout
  [ ] calculateFee() is imported from one place, not duplicated
  [ ] Amount used in fee calculation comes from storage, not client input
  [ ] Escrow invariant (locked + released + refunded === total) is asserted on write

HIGH:
  [ ] Idempotency key is deterministic (taskId + claimId based, not random)
  [ ] Multi-slot approvals are serialized, not concurrent
  [ ] Expiry job re-reads claim status before refunding
  [ ] write-then-pay order used, not pay-then-write
  [ ] USDC amounts use bigint arithmetic, not float

MEDIUM:
  [ ] Storage writes use atomic rename pattern
  [ ] Storage is re-read (not cached) before each mutation
  [ ] Task status and escrow status are updated in the same upsert call
  [ ] Slot counts (slots_filled, slots_remaining) are updated on rejection/approval
```

### 13.6 Integration with `blue chat`

When a user asks about escrow in chat context:

- Always explain the 5% fee: "The platform takes a 5% fee. On a $10 task, the worker gets $9.50."
- Always clarify that escrow is simulated: "Funds are tracked offchain but payouts go on-chain via USDC on Base."
- When user asks about a failed payout: ask for the `payout_tx` field from the claim record
- When user asks how to check if a task paid out: `blue micro list` shows escrow status per task

### 14.5 Key Invariants — Quick Reference Card

```
1. released + refunded + locked === total  (escrow ledger invariant)
2. Only "funded" escrow can release or refund
3. Only "submitted" claims can be approved or rejected
4. payout_processed = true → never pay again
5. Amount from storage, never from client
6. calculateFee() in one place, imported everywhere
7. Idempotency key = sha256(operation:taskId:claimId)
8. Serialize multi-slot approvals (no concurrent writes)
9. Re-read storage immediately before every mutation
10. bigint for on-chain math, display float for terminal only
```
