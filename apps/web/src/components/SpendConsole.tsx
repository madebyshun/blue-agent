/**
 * AGENT SPEND — the wallet's reason to exist.
 *
 * Every other wallet can show that 0.05 USDC left for `0x0295…`. None of them
 * can show WHAT IT BOUGHT, because the tool id only ever existed in the request
 * that triggered the payment. This panel is that join, aggregated: per tool,
 * per day, across both rails that pay for a Hub call.
 *
 * Mounted in TWO places, which is why it lives in `components/` and not under a
 * route folder: /app/usage (the spend console proper) and the Blue Hub home,
 * where the money is actually spent. Neither mount gates on a connected
 * address, so the `disconnected` branch below is reachable from both — getting
 * that branch wrong is what made this file move out of a route folder at all.
 *
 * It used to hang off /app/wallet. Moved 2026-09 because the wallet and
 * /app/usage were answering the SAME question — "what did I spend on
 * BlueAgent" — from the same ledger, in different units, on two pages a user
 * reaches separately. Two renderings of one number can disagree, and the split
 * is now by subject: /app/wallet is money you hold and move, /app/usage is what
 * you consumed. The wallet keeps a link where the panel was.
 *
 * ─── Two columns, never one ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * USDC and credits are NOT added together anywhere in this file, and no single
 * credit figure is printed in dollars. The reason is in spend-summary.ts and is
 * worth repeating where someone might "tidy this up": a credit debit drains the
 * FREE daily allowance first, and the event records only the total — so a
 * 50-credit call may have cost the user nothing. There is a published rate, so
 * the conversion is one multiplication away and would be a fabricated number.
 *
 * The single exception is `credits.paidAllTime`, which the ledger accumulates
 * separately and which therefore IS real money — shown once, as a lifetime
 * aggregate, never attributed to a tool.
 *
 * ─── The chart measures calls, not money ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Bar height is CALLS, which is the one unit both rails genuinely share. A
 * stacked money bar would require exactly the addition described above.
 *
 * ─── Floors, not totals ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both stores are bounded (100 receipts / 90-day TTL; HISTORY_CAP ledger
 * events). Everything here is a floor over a recorded window and says so. The
 * flags come from the API rather than being re-derived here — a component that
 * decides on its own when to print "all-time" is how a total starts lying.

 * to 100 receipts / 90-day TTL on x402, HISTORY_CAP events with no time bound
 * on credits). A receipt from 60 days ago is inside the total and outside the
 * chart, so the label overstated nothing and understated the window — either
 * way it described a span the number did not have, which is the same mistake
 * as "NET WORTH" over a stablecoins-only figure (#322).
 *
 * Derived from the oldest row that was actually counted, so it cannot drift
 * from the data no matter which cap bites first.
 *
 * ⚠ Returns `null` for "no span can be stated", which is NOT the same as the
 * string "no activity recorded". `oldestTs` is null in two situations that look
 * identical from here and are opposites: nothing was spent, or nothing could be
 * read. The first shipped as the second on 2026-08-27, when Upstash suspended
 * the production database and /wallet printed "no activity recorded" in the
 * header directly above two rails that said "unavailable" — the exact adjacency
 * bug as "Stablecoin 0%" under "No assets yet" (#322), reintroduced one PR after
 * it was fixed, because the render guard checked whether the FETCH succeeded and
 * a 200 carrying two dead rails passes that test.
 *
 * So the statuses are read here, and read from the same two fields the rails
 * themselves render — not from the sibling `partial` flag, which is derived from
 * the same nulls but is a second copy of the fact. One source, so the header and
 * the rails under it cannot contradict each other.
