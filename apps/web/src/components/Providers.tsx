// The Farcaster / Base App Mini App connector talks to a host frame over
// postMessage. It is NOT inert in a normal browser tab: with no host to
// answer, including it made wagmi hang on "Connecting…" for injected wallets
// (MetaMask/Rabby) — only Coinbase, which uses its own SDK, still worked.
// Mini Apps always render embedded (iframe / webview), so only register the
// connector when we're inside a host frame; a normal top-level tab gets just
// Coinbase + injected, restoring desktop wallet connect.
const inMiniAppFrame = typeof window !== "undefined" && window.top !== window.self;

// Connectors + transports are shared by BOTH the default and the Privy wagmi
// config so the external-wallet list and RPCs can't drift between the two
// provider paths.
//
// We deliberately do NOT register a generic `injected()` connector.
// wagmi v3 has EIP-6963 multi-injected discovery ON by default, so every
// installed extension (MetaMask, Rabby, Phantom…) is surfaced as its own
// connector backed by that wallet's *isolated* provider.
//
// The generic `injected()` connector instead talks to the shared
// `window.ethereum`, which — when several extensions are installed — is a
// multiplexed proxy that frequently resolves to a non-responding provider.
// That made `connect()` hang on "Connecting…" for MetaMask/Rabby while only
// Coinbase (its own SDK) worked. Dropping it routes injected wallets through
// EIP-6963's per-wallet providers, fixing the hang.
// WalletConnect — the ONLY path for a wallet that is not a browser extension
// in this exact browser.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: before it, the registered connector list was Coinbase alone,
// and everything else arrived purely through EIP-6963 discovery. EIP-6963 is an
// extension-to-page handshake, so it can only ever surface wallets installed in
// the current desktop browser. That left a whole class of users with NO route
// in at all — anyone on a phone browser, and every mobile-only wallet (Rainbow,
// Trust, Zerion, MetaMask Mobile, Phantom Mobile). They were not "hard to
// connect"; they were unreachable. Coinbase's own QR fallback rescued exactly
// one wallet — its own.
//
// ENV-GATED on `NEXT_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`, matching the existing
// `PRIVY_ENABLED` pattern: unset → the array spreads to nothing and the
// connector list is byte-identical to before, so a missing var degrades to
// today's behaviour instead of throwing at module scope (`walletConnect()`
// requires a projectId and will reject an empty string at connect time).
// The project id is a PUBLIC client identifier from cloud.reown.com — safe to
// inline in the bundle, not a secret.
//
// ⚠️ NOTE THE MISSING `NEXT_PUBLIC_` PREFIX, and do not "fix" it. This is a
// client module, so Next would normally inline nothing without that prefix —
// the value reaches the browser only because `next.config.ts` lists this key
// under `env`, which inlines at build time with no prefix rule. The Vercel
// variable cannot be named `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` on this project, hence the mapping.
// If you rename this, rename it in next.config.ts in the same commit or
// WalletConnect goes dark with no error anywhere.
//
// `@walletconnect/ethereum-provider` ships as a dependency of
// `@wagmi/connectors`, so this adds no new package; wagmi lazy-imports it on
// first connect, keeping it out of the initial bundle.

  // `@walletconnect/ethereum-provider`'s keyvaluestorage, which reaches for
  // `indexedDB` — absent in Node. That surfaced as
  // `unhandledRejection: ReferenceError: indexedDB is not defined` on every
  // server render (measured: 0 occurrences without this connector, 3 with it,
  // same page loads). Gating on `window` keeps WC off the server entirely.
  //
  // A server/client connector-list difference is already the established shape
  // in this file — `inMiniAppFrame` above does exactly the same thing — because
  // the connector list is only ever read from client components
  // (`useWallet()` → `useConnect()`), never rendered during SSR.
  //
  // Mini App hosts carry their own wallet, so a QR modal inside an embedded
  // frame is a dead end — register WC for top-level tabs only.
