// Token trust — CAN this app vouch for the row it is about to render, and may
// it offer a one-click Sell on it?
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the portfolio table rendered every token Moralis
// returned, identically, with a live `Sell ▾` on each row. A real wallet on
// Base came back holding
//     USDC   — "United States of Doge CashCat"
//     $ETH   — "$Ethereum Token Hood"
//     AI     — "Open AI"
// none of which are what their symbol says. Moralis' own `possible_spam` flag
// missed all three. The fake USDC then sorted into the STABLECOIN tier (see
// `rank()` in ./holdings.ts, which keyed off `STABLES.has(symbol)`) and landed
// two rows under the card showing the user's REAL USDC balance — which is
// exactly the confusion those tokens are minted to create.
//
// This is CLAUDE.md hard rule #2 applied to the wallet: **a ticker string never
// identifies a token; chain + address does.** Name-matching a ticker is how an
// impostor got into the RH registry (#280). The same mistake here does not just
// mislabel a row — it puts a trade button on it.
//
// Three-valued for the same reason `identity.ts` is: "we cannot vouch for this"
// is a real answer, distinct from "this is a fake". Collapsing them would
// either brand every legitimate long-tail token a scam, or wave the scams
// through. See CLAUDE.md: missing data is "unknown", never an inferred negative.
