/**
 * Per-payer x402 receipts — the one thing only Blue Agent can know.
 *
 * A Hub tool call settles USDC on Base to the treasury. On-chain that is all
 * anyone can see: `0xUSER → 0x0295…, 0.05 USDC`. Rainbow shows it that way.
 * Zerion shows it that way. OUR OWN wallet page showed it that way, because
 * the semantics — WHICH tool, for WHAT input, returning WHAT verdict — lived
 * only in the request that triggered it and were thrown away at settle time.
 *
 * `x402-settlements.ts` kept an aggregate meter (count + units + last tx) and
 * its header stated the payer address is never stored. That was true, and it
 * is why the timeline could not name a single payment the user had made. This
 * file is the deliberate, narrow reversal of that: receipts filed under the
 * payer, so the wallet can say "Blue Hub · honeypot-check · $0.05" where it used
 * to say "Sent to 0x0295…".
 *
 * Who can read them: only the wallet itself, since 2026-09-30 (plan §2, W0-6).
 * Until then `/api/wallet/spend` was an unauthenticated GET, and this header
 * said why a lone gate would be theatre: the credits rail published the same
 * join (`reason: "tool:<id>"`) at `/api/credits/balance/[address]`. So they
 * went private TOGETHER, behind one SIWE check: this route, /spend-summary,
 * and the per-event `?detail=1` of the balance route (whose aggregate balance
 * stays public). See lib/acting-wallet.ts.
 *
 * Scope of what is stored — deliberately the minimum that makes a receipt a
 * receipt:
 *   - the tool id          (which is already public in the catalog)
 *   - the price in units   (which is already public in the catalog)
 *   - the settlement tx    (which is already public on Base)
 *   - the timestamp        (which is already public on Base)
 * The *join* is the new information, not any single field. No inputs, no
 * outputs, no results are recorded — a receipt says what you bought, never
 * what you asked or what came back.
 *
 * Bounded on both axes: last MAX_RECEIPTS per wallet, and the row expires
 * after TTL_S. This is a receipt drawer, not a permanent dossier.
 *
 * FORWARD-ONLY, like `usage:<id>` and the settlement meter. It starts accruing
 * at deploy. Payments made before that have no receipt and MUST render without
 * a tool name — see the note on `getSpendLog`. Guessing the tool from
 * "amount ≈ a catalog price and the timestamp is close" would be inference
 * dressed as a fact, which is the one thing this whole surface must not do.

/**
 * File ONE receipt. Call only after `cdpSettle(...).ok === true` — a receipt
 * for a payment that did not clear is a false record of a charge.
 *
 * Best-effort and non-throwing, for the same reason `recordSettlement` is: the
 * USDC has already moved, the user already has their answer, and a KV hiccup
 * must not turn a successful paid call into an error response.
 *
 * ⚠ "Best-effort" means THIS receipt may be lost. It has never meant the
 * ninety-nine before it may be. This is a read-modify-write against a fixed-
 * depth drawer, so the read failing and the write succeeding is the one
 * combination that destroys data instead of merely dropping some:
 *
 *   read throws → treated as "no receipts yet" → append → write [1 row]
 *
 * — and up to MAX_RECEIPTS rows of a paying user's history are gone, with a
 * fresh TTL on top. Which is why the read below goes through `kvGetProbe`: an
 * error and an empty drawer must not arrive here as the same value. Same
 * distinction `getSpendLog` needs for the same reason, in the opposite
 * direction — there it misreports history, here it deletes it.
 *
 * Still lossy under concurrency, and knowingly so: two settlements for the same
 * payer can both read N rows and both write N+1, dropping one. That is a
 * one-row gap, not a wipe, and closing it needs RPUSH/LTRIM — which these keys
 * cannot take without migrating every existing JSON-string row (RPUSH against a
 * string key is a WRONGTYPE error), on the payment path. Not worth it for a
 * figure `spend-summary.ts` already publishes as a floor over a bounded window.
