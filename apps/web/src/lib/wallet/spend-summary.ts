/**
 * The agent's spend console — one answer across BOTH rails that pay for a tool.
 *
 * A Hub tool call can be paid two completely different ways, and until now each
 * had its own page that knew nothing about the other:
 *
 *   x402   → real USDC on Base, per call, settled via CDP. `spend:<addr>`.
 *   credits→ an off-chain metered balance, debited per call. `ledger:<addr>`.
 *
 * So "what did my agent spend" had two half-answers and no whole one. This file
 * is the whole one. It groups both rails by tool and by day so /app/usage can
 * show the thing no block explorer can: not that money left, but what it bought.
 * (It rendered on /app/wallet until 2026-09 — same component, moved to sit with
 * the credit balance it shares a ledger with.)
 *
 * ─── The one number this file refuses to compute ────────────────────────────
 *
 * It NEVER adds credits to USDC, and never converts a single credit event into
 * dollars. There is a published rate (CREDITS_PER_USDC), so the arithmetic is
 * trivial and the result would be wrong:
 *
 *   `spend()` drains the FREE daily allowance first and only the overflow
 *   reaches the paid pool — but the event it writes records the TOTAL and never
 *   the split. A 50-credit event may have cost the user nothing at all.
 *
 * Multiply that by $0.0005 and you have told a user they spent money they did
 * not spend. The only honest dollar figure on the credit rail is
 * `credits.paidAllTime`, which `spend()` accumulates on the row itself — and it
 * is a lifetime aggregate, so it cannot be attributed to any single tool either.
 * Hence two columns, side by side, never one.
 *
 * ─── Windows, not lifetimes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both underlying rows are deliberately bounded (100 receipts / 90-day TTL;
 * HISTORY_CAP ledger events). Every per-tool and per-day figure here is
 * therefore a FLOOR over a recorded window, not an all-time total, and the
 * flags that say so travel with the data instead of being re-derived by
 * whoever renders it.
 *
 * ─── What is deliberately absent ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Spend per session" was in the brief and is NOT here, because it is not in
 * the data: neither rail records a session or conversation id (`ref` is unset
 * on every chat debit). Grouping calls into "sessions" by clustering timestamps
 * would be a guess rendered as a fact — the same move as naming a payment from
 * "amount ≈ a catalog price", which this whole surface exists to not do.
