/**
 * Blue Chat — server-side store for background scheduled tasks.
 *
 * The Scheduled panel has always kept tasks in localStorage and fired them from
 * a mount-only effect, which means a "daily 09:00" task fires whenever you next
 * open the tab and never at 09:00. This module is the durable half of the fix:
 * the copy a cron can read while the browser is closed.
 *
 * ── Ownership is proved, never asserted ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Every function here takes an already-authenticated wallet. The route above it
 * reads that wallet from the SIWE session cookie (`lib/session.ts`) and NEVER
 * from a request body. This is not symmetry with the rest of the app — it is a
 * deliberate step up from it, and the reason is that a background task is a
 * standing instruction to spend. `/api/chat` accepts a client-supplied address
 * for a single message the user is watching; accepting one here would let anyone
 * install ten daily tasks against a stranger's wallet and drain their credits
 * every morning, unattended, until someone noticed. A signature is cheap; that
 * is not.
 *
 * ── Budget ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Upstash has been suspended three times on this project for exceeding its
 * request budget (#148), so the read pattern is designed around it rather than
 * discovered afterwards:
 *
 *   crons:next        one integer — the earliest `nextAt` across every owner.
 *                     An idle tick reads THIS KEY AND NOTHING ELSE and returns.
 *                     288 ticks/day × 1 read = ~8.6k reads/month, flat, however
 *                     many users exist.
 *   crons:owners      a real Redis SET (SADD/SREM are atomic — no read-modify-
 *                     write, so two concurrent enrolments cannot lose one).
 *   crons:w:<wallet>  that wallet's task list.
 *
 * The watermark is CLAMPED on write to at most an hour out. A corrupted or
 * far-future value would otherwise be permanent: nothing would ever re-read the
 * owners set, so nothing would ever fix it. The clamp bounds the damage at one
 * hour of missed firing and costs one full pass per hour in the worst case.
 *
 * ── Why a separate key instead of `workspace:<wallet>.sections.crons` ────────
 * The workspace blob already mirrors crons for users who enabled sync, so
 * reusing it is tempting and wrong. The scheduler writes run results; the
 * browser writes the whole blob. Both would be read-modify-write against ONE
 * key, so a tick landing between a client's read and its PUT silently discards
 * whatever the user did in between — and that key also holds their entire
 * conversation history. That is the #147/#150 wipe, aimed at the most valuable
 * key we have. Separate keys mean the scheduler owns exactly what it writes.
