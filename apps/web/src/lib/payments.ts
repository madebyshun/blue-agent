 * Single source of truth for the chat-credit top-up feature ("Pay with USDC").

 *   - client  → components/TopUpModal.tsx  (builds the USDC transfer)
 *   - server  → app/api/credits/purchase/route.ts  (verifies + credits)

 * Non-custodial: the user signs a direct USDC transfer from their own wallet to
 * the Blue treasury; the server only READS the settled transaction and credits
 * the off-chain ledger. Nothing here ever holds a key or moves funds itself.
