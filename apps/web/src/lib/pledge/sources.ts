/**
 * Where pledge transfers are read from.
 *
 * Three adapters, all answering the same question — "which ERC-20 transfers of
 * the old token landed in the receiving wallet?" — with different trade-offs:
 *
 *   • Moralis    (Base) — indexed, full history, one paged call. Needs a key.
 *   • Blockscout (RH)   — indexed, full history, one paged call. No key.
 *   • RPC getLogs (both) — trustless but pages over block ranges, so it is the
 *     FALLBACK, used only when the indexer for that chain fails.
 *
 * Why an indexer leads on a page whose whole promise is verifiability: the
 * alternative was measured, not assumed. Scanning from genesis at a 9,500-block
 * range costs 5,239 sequential calls on Base and 3,426 on RH; at the 0.51s per
 * call measured against the public RPC on 2026-08-10 that is ~74 minutes for a
 * single ledger build, against a Vercel function ceiling of 10–60s. The page
 * would never have loaded. Pinning `fromBlock` (config.ts) makes the RPC path
 * viable as a fallback; the indexers make the normal path instant. Every row
 * still carries its tx hash and links to the explorer, so nothing here has to
 * be taken on trust from either source.
 *
 * ─── The rule every adapter obeys ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * Return ALL the transfers, or return an error. Never return some of them.
 * A silently short list is the single worst failure this file can have: the
 * holder sees their pledge missing from a public ledger and concludes it was
 * taken. `getLogsRange` below is written around that rule.

 * Exported for `scripts/pledge-ledger-test.ts`, which drives it with a client

 * The single chokepoint every consumer of pledge data reads through.

 *
 *   • The pledge window CLOSED 2026-08-24 (config.ts). The eligible set is
 *     final; nothing new can land, so there is nothing for a live scan to find.
 *   • The live sources were, at close, unreliable in the one direction this
 *     page cannot tolerate. Moralis 401'd (key lapsed), Blockscout 403'd
 *     (Cloudflare), Base RPC rate-limited, and the RH RPC returned a SHORT
 *     list — 10 of 18 transfers. A silently short public ledger reads to a
 *     holder as their pledge having been TAKEN; it was live in production
 *     (RH: 10 wallets/10 txs against a true 16/18) and is the bug this fixes.
 *
 * The frozen set was reconstructed once, exhaustively, from on-chain Transfer
 * logs on both chains — every range scanned, every row carrying its own tx
 * hash and block timestamp, deadline-filtered, self-checked against the totals.
 * It returns through the same `SourceResult` contract, so all downstream
 * aggregation and rendering is unchanged; only the provenance differs, and it
 * is reported honestly as `source: "frozen"`.
 *
 * The live adapters above are KEPT — `scripts/pledge-ledger-test.ts` drives
 * `getLogsRange`, and they document exactly how the frozen set was derived so a
 * future re-verification does not start from scratch. If the window is ever
 * reopened, restore the indexer-first/RPC-second body preserved in git history.
