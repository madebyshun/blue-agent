/**
 * Blue Hub v2 — Hosted Tools
 *
 * A "hosted" tool is one Blue Hub runs on the creator's behalf (unlike an
 * "external" tool, where the creator hosts their own endpoint — see
 * lib/hub-registry.ts). Two templates:
 *
 *   ai_tool      → a creator-authored prompt, run through the Bankr LLM.
 *   api_wrapper  → forwards the call to an upstream HTTP API, optionally
 *                  injecting a secret auth header the creator supplies.
 *
 * Split: 90% creator / 10% Blue Hub. Because a single x402 payment settles via
 * EIP-3009 to ONE payTo (no on-chain fan-out), the invoke route (see
 * /api/hub/community/[slug]/invoke) settles the full amount to the Blue Hub
 * wallet and ACCRUES the creator's 90% in KV (`builder:earned:<wallet>`) for a
 * batched/manual payout. This file holds the registry + the pure runners; it
 * does NOT touch payment.
 *
 * ── SECURITY (read before editing) ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `HostedTool.config` holds SECRETS: an api_wrapper's `authValue` (e.g. a
 * bearer token) and an ai_tool's `systemPrompt`. These MUST NEVER reach a
 * client. Every public read path goes through `toPublicHostedTool()`, which
 * drops `config` and `signature`. Only the server-side runners read `config`.
 *
 * The ai_tool `systemPrompt` is CREATOR-SUPPLIED, UNTRUSTED DATA. `runAiTool`
 * wraps it in a platform safety envelope so a malicious prompt cannot make the
 * model impersonate Blue Agent, solicit secrets/seed phrases/payments, exfil
 * the tool's own configuration, or emit disallowed content. Do not "simplify"
 * by passing the creator prompt straight through as the system message.
