/**
 * x402 settlement ledger — real USDC settled on Base via the Coinbase CDP facilitator.
 *
 * Every paid tool call that clears CDP `/settle` moves USDC on-chain to the Blue
 * Hub wallet (0xb058…). We record ONLY confirmed settlements (settle.ok === true)
 * here so the /stats page can show the actual amount Coinbase CDP has settled —
 * not the runs×price ESTIMATE (which counts internal-bypass / free / failed-settle
 * calls too). The number is therefore a strict, honest lower-bound of paid volume.
 *
 * Aggregate only: a running count + summed micro-units + the latest tx hash (for a
 * one-click Basescan proof). No wallet, no per-user data is ever stored — the payer
 * address is never part of any key or value.
 *
 * Forward-only, like the `usage:<id>` run counters: it starts accruing at deploy
 * time. That is intentional and truthful — it is a live meter of CDP settlements,
 * not a backfilled historical total. A KV failure degrades every read to null so
 * /stats renders an honest "—", never a fabricated figure.
