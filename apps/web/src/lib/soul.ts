/**
 * SOUL — Blue Agent's identity layer, and the single source of truth for it.
 *
 * Why this file exists as TypeScript rather than as the root SOUL.md:
 *
 * The /soul page told visitors SOUL.md is "loaded into every chat session as the
 * core identity layer". It wasn't. Nothing read it at runtime — the page kept a
 * hand-typed copy of the content, the root SOUL.md kept its own, and the chat
 * system prompt had neither. Three copies, and the two visible ones had already
 * drifted (the file still listed /console, /market, /micro and /score, none of
 * which exist, and pointed the LLM rule at llm.bankr.bot, which is 403 banned).
 *
 * So the text lives here, in the one place both consumers can import:
 *   - /api/chat  prepends SOUL_MD to the system prompt → the claim is now true
 *   - /soul      renders SOUL_SECTIONS → the page can no longer drift from it
 *   - SOUL.md    at the repo root is generated from SOUL_MD by
 *                `npm run sync:soul`, so the forkable file stays a real,
 *                byte-identical copy rather than a third hand-maintained one.
 *
 * Keep it short. Every line here is paid for on every single chat request, so
 * this is identity and hard limits only — operational detail (tool routing,
 * output length, credits) belongs in BASE_SYSTEM in api/chat/route.ts.
