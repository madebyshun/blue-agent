/**
 * Blue Hood — Base desk poll (Base P3).
 *
 * The Robinhood poller (`blue-hood/poller.ts`) owns the RH watchlist, the
 * permanent series archive, and every snapshot KV write. This module is
 * deliberately SMALLER and side-effect-free: it only produces `TickerSnapshot`
 * rows for the verified Coinbase B20 stocks in `registry.ts::BASE_STOCKS`
 * (NVDA / META / GOOGL / AAPL today — read the registry, never hardcode the
 * list) so the chain-agnostic rule engine can grade Base drift/arb alongside RH.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT DOES NOT PERSIST SNAPSHOTS OR TOUCH THE SERIES ARCHIVE. Base rows are
 * merged into the engine's in-memory snapshot only. The permanent series is
 * keyed by bare `ticker`, and NVDA/META/GOOGL/AAPL exist on BOTH chains — writing a
 * Base "NVDA" row into that no-TTL, no-backfill archive would corrupt the RH
 * "NVDA" history irreversibly. So Base stays out of `persistSnapshot`/series by
 * construction; the dedup/cooldown/grader keys are chain-qualified instead
 * (see `kv-keys.ts::chainSeg`, `rule-engine.ts::fireArrow`, `grader.ts`).
 *
 * ── Mapping contract (mirror of `poller.ts::pollOne`, sourced from
 *    `readBaseStockQuote` instead of the rh-stock-arb M5 tool) ────────────────
 *   • can_fire === false → verdict INSUFFICIENT_DATA **and** drift_pct null.
 *     This is the single most load-bearing line in the file: a paused /
 *     bad-multiplier / stale-feed / impostor / dead-sequencer token must be
 *     UNGRADEABLE. Two INDEPENDENT guards each stop `detectCandidate`
 *     (verdict-early-return AND null-drift), so no single one is load-bearing —
 *     this is hazard #1 (silent wrong price) defended in depth.
 *   • can_fire === true  → verdict derived with the SAME rules as rh-stock-arb
 *     (open: ALIGNED / LONG_DEX / SHORT_DEX; closed: FROZEN_ALIGNED /
 *     PREMARKET_DRIFT / AFTERHOURS_DRIFT). `drift_pct` already uses the
 *     identical sign convention (positive ⟹ DEX above oracle), so a Base row and
 *     an RH row with the same drift fire the same arrow and are M5-comparable.
 *
 * The Base underlyings are US equities, so they trade on the SAME NYSE clock as
 * RH stocks — we reuse `nyseMarketStatus()` verbatim (chain-agnostic hours).
