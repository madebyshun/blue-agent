/**
 * Base B20 stock quote — the "Base desk" price source for Blue Hood.
 *
 * This is the Base analogue of Robinhood Chain's oracle read, with ONE critical
 * extra layer that RH doesn't have: the **multiplier**. A Coinbase B20 tokenized
 * stock's Chainlink feed reports the *total-return value* — the share price
 * multiplied by a WAD-scaled `multiplier()` rebase factor — not the raw share
 * price. Read the feed answer naively and you get a price that is silently wrong
 * whenever the multiplier ≠ 1e18. So every share price here goes through
 * `sharePriceFromFeed`, which divides the multiplier back out in WAD math.
 *
 * ── Fail-loud, never fail-silent (hazard #1) ──────────────────────────────────
 * `sharePriceFromFeed` THROWS if the multiplier is ≤ 0. `readBaseStockQuote`
 * treats an unreadable/zero multiplier as a hard block: it logs (console.error)
 * and returns a quote with `share_price_usd: null` and `can_fire: false` — it
 * NEVER falls back to the raw feed answer, because a silent wrong price is the
 * most dangerous bug this module can have (lesson: kv.ts "fail silently" cost us
 * twice). "Cannot assess" is the correct output when the multiplier is in doubt.
 *
 * ── Defense-in-depth gates (each can suppress an arrow) ───────────────────────
 *   • impostor  — token must pass isB20() ∧ decimals==8 ∧ symbol=="<TICKER>c".
 *                 The `0xb200…` prefix is trivially forgeable and isB20() alone
 *                 is not proof (it answers true for empty prefixed addresses),
 *                 so we pin against the authoritative registry symbol (#280).
 *   • sequencer — Base is an OP-stack L2; if its sequencer is down or only just
 *                 recovered (< grace), feeds may be stale/frozen → don't fire.
 *   • multiplier— unreadable or ≤ 0 → hazard block (see above).
 *   • identity  — `share == total_return ÷ (multiplier / 1e18)` is re-derived on
 *                 EVERY read and must hold, or the row is suppressed. This is
 *                 #224's assertion given a RUNNER: the probe that owns it is a
 *                 manual npm script no workflow invokes, so it only ran on days
 *                 someone remembered. The Base poll reads `multiplier()` every 5
 *                 minutes regardless, so the check rides along for free. Read
 *                 `verifySharePriceIdentity` for what it does and does not catch
 *                 while every multiplier still reads exactly 1e18.
 *   • pause     — isPaused(TRANSFER) true (or unreadable) → suppress.
 *   • staleness — Chainlink `is_stale` (older than 2× heartbeat) → suppress.
 *                 ⚠️ Coinbase equity feeds DO NOT tick while US markets are
 *                 closed, so every Base ticker goes stale ~48h after Friday's
 *                 last print and stays stale until Monday's open. Suppressing
 *                 there is CORRECT — you cannot grade drift against a frozen
 *                 oracle — but it means a weekend read says nothing about a
 *                 ticker's quality. Measured 2026-09-06 (Sun): all 10 admitted
 *                 + candidate feeds last ticked Fri 2026-09-04, spread only by
 *                 what time that day they stopped. Do not read a weekend
 *                 `feed_stale` as evidence against a ticker (see the admission
 *                 probe, which classifies it INCONCLUSIVE rather than FAIL).
 *   • sane band — oracle or DEX price outside the registry's per-ticker
 *                 `saneBand` → the read is broken, not newsworthy → suppress.
 *   • dex       — no DEX spot → drift is undefined → can't fire (but oracle
 *                 share price is still returned for display).
 *
 * `drift_pct` is populated whenever BOTH prices exist (for honest display), but
 * `can_fire` — the "an arrow may be graded from this" flag — requires every gate
 * green. Phase 3 (poller/grader wiring) keys off `can_fire`, not on the presence
 * of a number.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ TRAP FOR A FUTURE BASE TRADE PATH: approve() IS NOT POLICY GATED ───────
 * READ THIS BEFORE WRITING ANY BUY/SELL FLOW FOR A B20 TOKEN.
 *
 * This module is READ-ONLY today — it quotes, it never trades — so the trap
 * below is not live. It is written here because this is the file someone will
 * open first when they add one, and because the failure it causes looks like a
 * success.
 *
 * B20 transfers are gated by the issuer's policy layer: an account must pass
 * `isAuthorized(policyID, account)` (KYC / whitelist / jurisdiction — the
 * tokenized stocks are non-US-eligible only) or the transfer reverts.
 * **`approve()` is NOT policy gated.** An unauthorized wallet can set an
 * allowance successfully and only discover the block when the swap reverts.
 *
 * That breaks the shape of our RH allowance pre-check (#122), which infers
 * "this wallet can trade" from "approve succeeded". On Base that inference is
 * INVALID and would show a FALSE GREEN: the UI says ready, the user signs, the
 * transaction reverts, and they pay gas to learn they were never eligible.
 *
 * So a Base trade path must call `isAuthorized(policyID, account)` explicitly
 * as its own gate — a successful `approve()` proves nothing about eligibility.
 * Ref: docs.base.org/base-chain/asset-issuance/tokenized-stocks-on-base.

 *
 * `scripts/base-stocks-probe.ts` already asserts `share == total_return ÷
 * (multiplier / 1e18)` unconditionally, and that fix was right. What it did not
 * come with was a RUNNER: the probe is a manual `npm run test:base-stocks`, it
 * does not match `run-tests.ts`'s `*-check.ts` discovery pattern, and no
 * workflow invokes it. A check nobody schedules is a check that runs on the days
 * someone remembers — which is the same failure mode as the self-retiring
 * assertion it replaced, one level up. So the identity moves to where the inputs
 * already are: the Base desk poll, which reads `multiplier()` every 5 minutes
 * anyway (`readTokenState`). No 7th cron, no extra KV traffic.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS ACTUALLY CATCHES, AND WHEN ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Be precise about this, because the honest answer has two halves.
 *
 * TODAY (every registered multiplier reads exactly 1e18) the identity reduces to
 * `share == total_return`, and the two sides are still computed by INDEPENDENT
 * routes — production goes `(raw_answer × WAD) / multiplier` in bigint then
 * scales by `10^feed_decimals`; this function divides `chainlinkLatest`'s
 * float `price_usd`. So a decimals mix-up, a truncation fault, a bigint
 * overflow, or a rewiring of `total_return_value_usd` shows up NOW.
 *
 * It does NOT catch the WAD-substitution bug today — a call site passing `WAD`
 * instead of `tok.multiplier` produces an identical number while the real
 * multiplier is 1e18, so no arithmetic anywhere can see it. That is a property
 * of the bug, not a weakness of this check, and it is exactly why the check must
 * be UNCONDITIONAL and CONTINUOUS: Base's B20 spec folds cash dividends into the
 * multiplier ("the multiplier increases to 1.02") rather than distributing them,
 * so the first ex-dividend date on any of the eight tickers arms this check by
 * itself. A check that has to be remembered is not armed on a date nobody
 * diarised.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A TAUTOLOGY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It would be, if it re-ran `sharePriceFromFeed` and compared. It does not: it
 * never touches `raw_answer` or `feed_decimals`, and reaches the same quantity
 * through the feed's already-scaled USD price and a float multiplier. Two routes,
 * one answer — that is a cross-check. (Contrast the probe's SANE_BAND note, which
 * refuses to derive its bands from the registry's for the same reason.)
 *
 * ── WHY "unchecked" IS A STATE AND NOT A SILENT PASS ─────────────────────────
 * #224 was never "a check computed the wrong answer". It was "a check quietly
 * stopped running while the summary still said PASSED". Collapsing `unchecked`
 * into `ok` would rebuild that exact hole inside the fix for it. Every
 * `unchecked` today also has a louder sibling (`multiplier_invalid`,
 * `feed_unavailable`, `share_price_unavailable`) — but *inferring* the hole from
 * a neighbouring field is precisely the reasoning that let the old assertion
 * disappear, so it is named here rather than deduced.
