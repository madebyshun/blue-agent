/**
 * Blue Hub v2 — Builder Registry
 *
 * KV-backed (Upstash Redis) storage for community-submitted tools.
 * First-party tools live in src/lib/agent-tools.ts; this file handles
 * everything submitted via /hub/submit by external builders.
 *
 * Keys:
 *   hub:tools:index            → string[] of tool IDs (the master list)
 *   hub:tools:item:<id>        → RegisteredTool JSON
 *   hub:tools:calls:<id>       → integer (lifetime call count; mirrors usage:<id>)
 *   hub:tools:revenue:<id>     → integer (lifetime USDC units paid DIRECT to the
 *                                 builder, 100%; volume received, not a balance held)
 *   hub:builders:tools:<addr>  → string[] of tool IDs owned by this wallet
 *
 * ── KV WRITE DISCIPLINE (#150) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every write here that DERIVES its value from a prior read of the SAME key
 * goes through `kvMutate`, never `kvGet(K) ?? default → kvSet(K, …)`. `kvGet`
 * swallows a throw into `null`, so under the old shape one throttled read
 * replaced a whole collection with a one-element array (or a lifetime revenue
 * counter with a single call's share). See `putTool` and `addRevenue`.
 *
 * `removeTool` deliberately keeps the plain read: its writes are gated on
 * `ids.includes(id)`, which is false for the `[]` a failed read produces, so
 * the failure mode is a skipped de-index (self-healing — `getRegisteredTool`
 * returns null for the deleted item and the list readers filter it out), not a
 * wipe. Same verdict as its twin `hub-hosted.removeHostedTool`.
 *
 * ── KV READ DISCIPLINE (#150 group B) ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The reads have the mirror-image problem: `?? 0` / `?? []` publish a KV outage
 * as a FACT about a builder's money and inventory. There is no data loss, but
 * the answer is worse to look at — "$0.0000 earned" and "No tools registered
 * yet" are what a builder sees while their 12 tools and their balance sit
 * untouched in KV. So every read that feeds a builder-facing surface now comes
 * in two flavours:
 *
 *   `readX()` — the honest one. Distinguishes "absent" from "unreadable" and
 *               reports coverage. USE THIS on anything that publishes a number.
 *   `getX()`  — the legacy projection, DEFINED IN TERMS OF `readX()` so the two
 *               cannot drift. It collapses unreadable→absent, which is fine for
 *               callers that only ask "does this exist" (route 404s, uniqueness
 *               checks) and wrong for anything that renders a total.
 *
 * One implementation, two projections — deliberately not two implementations.
 * The hosted/external twins in this codebase disagreed for a whole release
 * because they were written twice (see the part-3 note on `addRevenue`).

     🔴 MEASURED 2026-09-26 — 5 of the 6 registered endpoints were dead while all
     6 still reported `status: "live"` to every visitor:
       hermes-evidence     pinggy-free tunnel    conn failed
       hermes-verify       pinggy-free tunnel    conn failed
       jefri-base-create2  lhr.life tunnel       503
       jefri-base-permit2  lhr.life tunnel       503
       indie-ops-ping      trycloudflare quick   conn failed
       desk-x402-block     Cloudflare Worker     402  ← the only one still up
     That is not neglect, it is the submit flow: builders test from a laptop behind
     an ephemeral tunnel (pinggy / lhr.life / trycloudflare all expire in hours),
     the probe passes, and the URL dies when they close the terminal. The Hub then
     advertises a dead tool as live indefinitely and never tells the builder.
     Note this is a SEPARATE fault from the payee bug documented above
     PAY_TO_WALLET in hub/HubView.tsx: desk-x402-block is up and still cannot be
     paid. Fixing liveness alone would surface exactly one payable tool, and it
     would still fail at checkout.
     ⚠️ Do NOT "clean up" by deleting dead tools — that is a builder's submission
     and tunnel expiry is expected. Re-probe and show staleness; any delisting is
     ShunTr's call. */

// ─── Strict x402 probe — the auto-live gate ────────────────────────────────────
//
// agentic.market model: an External tool goes live the moment it proves it is a
// working x402 endpoint — no human moderation. Spam without a real paid endpoint
// fails this probe and is rejected. Base-only per the platform rule.
//
// The probe sends an unauthenticated POST {} and looks for an x402 payment signal
// that is BROADER than "status === 402", because some real x402 gateways validate
// the request body FIRST and answer a body-less POST with 400 (missing fields) —
// while STILL advertising payment requirements in the `payment-required` /
// `x-payment-required` header (this is what blockrun.ai does). Treating those as
// "not x402" wrongly rejected valid paid endpoints. We now accept an endpoint if
// ANY of these hold, then parse the requirements (header first, then 402 body):
//   • HTTP 402                                              (canonical)
//   • a `payment-required` / `x-payment-required` header    (BlockRun, validate-first)
//   • `www-authenticate` header mentioning x402
//   • a JSON body carrying `x402Version` / `paymentInfo`, or the text "x402 payment"
// Requirements (payTo + asset + network) are then extracted and the network is
// verified as Base (8453 mainnet / 84532 sepolia). No signal → reject as before.
