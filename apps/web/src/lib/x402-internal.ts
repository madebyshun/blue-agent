/**
 * Headers for server-to-server calls to /api/x402/:tool.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The x402 route accepts an "internal bypass" for authorized callers so the
 * poller, crons, MCP, and other in-house code can execute paid tools without
 * transacting USDC on every call. The bypass requires TWO headers:
 *
 *   X-Blue-Internal: <INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY>   // proves the caller is our server
 *   X-Blue-Service:  internal                 // proves this isn't a browser
 *                                             //   guest replaying a stolen key
 *
 * See the key check in handle() of apps/web/src/app/api/x402/[tool]/route.ts,
 * and the guard in runInternalTool (lib/x402-internal-run.ts) that returns 402
 * WALLET_REQUIRED for paid tools when the second header is missing — the guard
 * that MCP tripped over from Jul → Sep 2026.
 *
 * Historically each caller assembled these headers inline, and the MCP route
 * shipped the first header but not the second when the guard was added.
 * Result: every paid MCP tool returned a text stub telling the LLM to "set
 * INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY" — silently, with HTTP 200. Route the headers through
 * this module so the next caller can't drift.
 *
 * If INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY is unset, the bypass headers are OMITTED — the
 * request falls through to normal x402 payment. Callers stay responsible for
 * handling the resulting 402 (crons should abort with a clear log).
 *
 * ⚠️ Code running INSIDE this app should not use these headers at all. Since
 * 2026-10-01 chat and MCP run catalog tools in-process via `runInternalTool`
 * (lib/x402-internal-run.ts): a fetch to `${NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/x402/…`
 * reaches PRODUCTION from every preview and localhost — and so runs prod's
 * build and needs prod's key. These headers are for callers that genuinely
 * cross the network to a chosen target: the Hood tool-caller's http mode
 * (BH_TOOL_TARGET) and the smoke scripts.

/**

 *     headers: internalX402Headers(),

 *   });
 *
 * If INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY is unset, only Content-Type is returned — the caller
