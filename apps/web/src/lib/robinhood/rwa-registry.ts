// Robinhood Chain RWA Registry — canonical tokenized-stock / ETF address book.
//
// Two authoritative sources:
//   1. Token contracts: every `Deployed(bytes32 uid, address stock, string name,
//      string symbol)` event emitted by the RHJ factory at RH_RWA_DEPLOYER.
//      docs.robinhood.com/chain/contracts is a *subset* — it lags the chain.
//   2. Chainlink price feeds: reference-data-directory.vercel.app/feeds-robinhood-mainnet.json
//      — the source-of-truth JSON that docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=robinhood
//      is generated from.
//
// ── Why this file is generated-then-committed, not hand-curated ─────────────
// It used to say "add a row here when Robinhood adds a stock", and that decayed
// exactly the way a manual list does: it held 26 rows while the chain held 203
// RHJ deployments. Everything downstream inherited the gap — ~30 rh-* tools
// resolve tickers through here, so real, deployer-verified stock tokens were
// invisible to all of them at once. Two of the misses were load-bearing: GME (a
// live token, thousands of buys) was listed under CHAINLINK_ONLY_FEEDS as "no
// contract yet" — while the only GME-named contract a searching user *would*
// find is an impersonator; and USO was filed under the ticker "CUSO" with a note
// claiming no feed, which made rh-rwa-verify raise a false scam alarm on a
// genuine canonical token.
//
// ── Why the factory log, and not the token list ────────────────────────────
// The first repair pass enumerated Blockscout `/api/v2/tokens?type=ERC-20` and
// kept the rows whose `creator_address_hash` matched the deployer. Sound logic,
// wrong index: `/tokens` is sorted by market cap and serves a fixed 50-row page
// (it accepts a `limit` param and ignores it — measured at 50/100/200). So that
// sweep could only see tokens that already had a market cap, and it "completed"
// at 96 rows while missing 107 real ones. A genuine RHJ deployment with no pool
// yet — exactly the new-listing case this registry exists to catch — sorts last
// and stays invisible. The 26→96 fix reproduced the original bug one layer down.
//
// A `Deployed` event cannot be ranked out of a list, needs no per-token creator
// lookup, and is impersonation-proof by construction: a contract cannot emit
// another contract's events, so membership here *is* the provenance proof that
// `creator == RH_RWA_DEPLOYER` was approximating. The fake GME (0x1c8a973a…,
// 2,362 holders) came out of thirdweb's TWCloneFactory and can never appear.
//
// So the rows below are produced by `npx tsx scripts/rwa-generate.ts --write`,
// then committed (a runtime fetch would put Blockscout in the request path of
// every quote — 2.4–8.8s per address call, measured). Keeping them honest is
// `npm run rwa:verify`, which re-runs the crawl read-only and exits non-zero on
// drift. Hand-edit only the display `name` / `sector` / `note` columns — the
// generator preserves those and regenerates everything else; never hand-add an
// address.
//
// Every stock/ETF token is issued by Robinhood Assets (Jersey) Limited (RHJ).
// Ticker, name and decimals are strings anyone can copy — the deployer is not.
// hub_rh_rwa_verify leads with provenance for that reason.

/**
 * The RHJ token factory — an `ERC1967Proxy`, not an EOA. Every canonical
 * stock/ETF token on RH Chain is born from a `deploy` call on it, and is also
 * reported as that token's `creator_address_hash`.
 *
 * This is the registry's one *provable* claim. Ticker and name are strings an
 * impersonator copies for free — the fake GME on this chain carries the exact
 * byte-for-byte name "GameStop • Robinhood Token" — but the contract that
 * created a contract is fixed at deployment and cannot be forged after the
 * fact. So provenance is the check that actually separates a real Robinhood
 * stock token from a copy, and `rh-rwa-verify` leads with it.
 *
 * Every RHJ row below was read out of this factory's own `Deployed` events —
 * that is the crawl's source, not a property checked afterwards (203/203 by
 * construction). `rh-rwa-verify` re-derives the same set independently through
 * `/api/v2/addresses/{token}` → creator_address_hash, so the two agree only if
 * both are right. WETH and USDG correctly do NOT match — different issuers, by
 * design, and `rh-rwa-verify` is expected to say so.

// that Robinhood hadn't published those token contracts yet. That was never
// true — every one of them was already deployed on chain by RH_RWA_DEPLOYER
// and simply absent from our hand-maintained list. The full deployer sweep
// promoted all 10 into RWA_TOKENS, so all 35 RH equity feeds now resolve to a
// real address. GME in particular was the tell: the registry claimed "no token
// contract", while the only GME-named contract a user would find by searching
// was an impersonator.
//
// Keep the array (the fallback path is legitimate — Chainlink can list a feed
// before RHJ deploys the token) but treat a non-empty value as a signal to
// re-run `npm run rwa:verify`, not as steady state.

/**
 * Normalise a ticker-list input to `string[]`, accepting BOTH a real array and
 * a comma-separated string.
 *
 * 🔴 This exists because two paid tools were 100% broken from the Hub UI and
 * nothing caught it. They both parsed their input as:
 *
 *     const tickersRaw = body.tickers ?? (query.get("tickers") ?? "").split(",")
 *
 * which splits the QUERY string but never the BODY. The Hub form posts JSON
 * whose values are all strings (HubView builds `Record<string,string>` from the
 * inputs), so `body.tickers` is `"AAPL,TSLA,NVDA"` — truthy, so `??` never
 * falls through — and a STRING then flows into array code:
 *
 *   • `tickersRaw.length` becomes the CHARACTER count, so the arity guard
 *     `length > 10` rejects any list over 10 characters with the thoroughly
 *     misleading "Provide `tickers` — 2 to 10 tickers."
 *   • a shorter string slips past that guard and dies on `.map is not a
 *     function`.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-26 against the real handlers:
 *   "AAPL,TSLA,NVDA"        → 400 "Provide `tickers` — 2 to 10 tickers."
 *   "AAPL,TSLA"             → 500 "tickersRaw.map is not a function"
 *   ["AAPL","TSLA","NVDA"]  → 200
 *
 * Both failures surface to the buyer as the same opaque "Tool failed — you were
 * not charged", so the tool looked merely flaky rather than structurally
 * unusable. The placeholders (`AAPL,TSLA,NVDA`) and rh-sector-basket's own
 * header ("comma-separated list of tickers") both advertised the string form,
 * so the documented contract was right and only the body path disagreed.
 *
 * Callers must use THIS for any ticker-list input rather than re-deriving the
 * `??`-plus-split idiom, which is what produced two copies of the same bug.
