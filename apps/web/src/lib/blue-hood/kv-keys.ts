 * history at all — three poll cycles and the evidence was gone. That is the

 * published RH drift arrows predate `SERIES_ARCHIVE_START` and can therefore
 * never be audited after the fact. Base is currently at the *start* of that
 * curve, and every hour not persisted now is an hour that can never be
 * recovered later.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE KEY AND NOT `bh:series:day:*`: that archive is keyed by BARE
 * TICKER and NVDA/META/GOOGL/AAPL trade on both chains. One Base row landing
 * there silently corrupts RH price history — irreversibly, because history
 * cannot be backfilled. The `bh:base:` prefix keeps the two disjoint under a
 * prefix scan, and the two record types are held apart by paired `chain`
 * discriminators — NOT by their field lists, which overlap enough that
 * `BaseSeriesDay` was silently assignable to `SeriesDay` until the
 * discriminator was added. See the header of `base-series.ts` for exactly what
 * the compiler does and does not enforce here. Same belt-and-braces reasoning
 * as `KV_BASE_ROWS_LATEST`, for the same reason.
 *
 * NO TTL, deliberately — this is the archive, not a cache.
 *
 * MEASURED COST at a 4-ticker `BASE_STOCKS` registry: ~0.4 KB per hourly point
 * (the RH archive measures 2.6 KB at 24 tickers), so ~10 KB/day, under 4 MB/year.
 *
 * The registry is now SEVEN tickers (AMZN/MSFT/MSTR admitted 2026-09-08), so
 * that 0.4 KB is history. Storage scales linearly with ticker count — DERIVED,
 * not re-measured: ~0.7 KB/point, ~17 KB/day, under 7 MB/year. Re-measure
 * before quoting it as fact.
 *
 * The REQUEST budget is unchanged by admissions and that is the number that
 * matters here: ~288 reads/day (one per 5-min cycle) plus ~24–40 writes,
 * regardless of how many tickers each cycle carries — roughly 2% of the
 * 500K/month Upstash cap that starved this engine in task #123. Admitting a
 * ticker costs bytes, not requests, so it does not move the constraint that
 * has actually suspended this project three times.
