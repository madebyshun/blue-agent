 * PERMANENT hourly oracle-vs-DEX price series — one key per UTC day.

 * snapshots, but it expires after 25h (TTL_SNAPSHOT_HOUR) because it exists to
 * feed a 24h sparkline. That makes it useless for anything that spans a market
 * closure: a weekend is 48–65h, so by Monday the Friday close is already gone.
 * Every hour we don't persist is an hour that can NEVER be recovered — unlike
 * code, price history cannot be backfilled later.
 *
 * So this key holds a deliberately tiny row (ticker, oracle, dex, drift, TVL)
 * and carries NO TTL. Full snapshots are ~20 tickers of verbose data and would
 * be wasteful to keep forever; this is the subset that answers "where was the
 * DEX trading while the oracle was frozen".
 *
 * WHY PER-DAY AND NOT PER-HOUR: per-hour keys would need no read-modify-write
 * at all, which is tempting. But the consumer reads SPANS — "how did the DEX
 * behave across the last six weekends" is 42 day-keys, versus 1,008 hour-keys.
 * The read path is the product, so it gets the cheap side of the trade, and
 * the write path pays for it with a guarded merge (`mergeSeriesPoint`).
 *
 * MEASURED COST at the current 24-ticker watchlist: 2.6 KB per hourly point,
 * 61 KB for a full day, 22 MB per year, and 312 KV requests/day (288 reads —
 * one per 5-min cycle — plus 24 writes). Against the 500K/month Upstash cap
 * that starved this engine once (task #123) that is ~2%, which is why the
