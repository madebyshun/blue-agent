/**
 * Blue Hood — alert engine (task 2.1).
 *
 * When an arrow fires for ticker T, this module resolves the WATCHERS of T
 * (kind-filtered, via 1.7's reverse index) and writes one CHANNEL-AGNOSTIC
 * alert record per recipient. It does NOT send anything itself — 2.2 (Telegram)
 * and, later, web-push read these records and deliver. "Blue Hood is the proof":
 * the arrow already fired + graded; 2.1 is only the fan-out substrate.
 *
 * WHERE IT RUNS: hooked into the async `brief-worker` cron, right after the
 * existing Web Push fan-out — NOT inside `fireArrow`/the poll cycle. The
 * async-brief refactor deliberately moved all fan-out off the hot poll path to
 * keep cycle wall-time flat; 2.1 rides the same rails so the engine's fire path
 * never slows (Req 2 / DoD).
 *
 * THREE INVARIANTS this file guarantees:
 *   1. FIRE-AND-FORGET — `emitAlertsForArrow` never throws. A failed alert can
 *      never break the arrow-fire path (the worker wraps the call in try/catch
 *      too, for defense in depth).
 *   2. NO REPLAY — the record id is deterministic (`${arrowId}:${addr}`), so
 *      re-emitting the same arrow is idempotent: one arrow → one alert/person.
 *   3. HEALTH-GATED — if the engine is blind (KV throttle → observable:false)
 *      or its snapshot is stale, we do NOT emit alerts off possibly-blind data;
 *      a wrong alert is worse than a missed one. We DON'T backfill (a late alert
 *      is worse than none) — but we DO log the miss with arrow_id + recipient
 *      count so a silent signal loss is always recoverable.
 *
 * CHANNEL MODEL (read `kv-keys.ts` 2.1 block too): each record carries a
 * per-channel `delivered` cursor so many channels share ONE record. The
 * `bh:alert:pending` queue is TELEGRAM'S alone — web-push finds its work via
 * `bh:alert:addr:{addr}` + a `delivered.webpush` cursor and must NOT drain the
 * queue.
