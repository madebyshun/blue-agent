/**
 * Blue Hood — arrow grader.
 *
 * Iterates every currently-open arrow whose grading window has elapsed
 * and hands it a verdict against a FRESH snapshot / M5 read. The engine
 * NEVER decides the outcome from stale numbers — we always re-read the
 * tool that fired it (spec: "graded by the same tools that fired it").
 *
 * P0.1 (2026-07-24) — GRADING CLOCK is market-aware.
 *   The window is measured in REGULAR-SESSION hours, not wall-clock
 *   hours. Chainlink stock feeds freeze while the market is closed, so
 *   the DEX↔oracle "gap" cannot close during those hours — a wall-clock
 *   grader inside a closed window produces guaranteed MISSes. The old
 *   #0040-#0047 drift cluster (fired 16:04-17:49 ET, graded 22:09-23:54
 *   ET, all inside closed market) is the canonical bug.
 *
 * Grading rules (spec Block 1.4):
 *   • drift: HIT if the DEX↔oracle gap closes ≥ 50% within the first
 *     `grading_window_h` REGULAR-session hours after the arrow fired.
 *     Fired outside regular hours → clock starts at next open.
 *     Fired inside regular hours → clock pauses at close, resumes next
 *     open. Same math for arb.
 *   • arb:   HIT if the spread falls below 0.5% within 4 regular-hours.
 *   • flow:  HIT if DEX price moves ≥ 1% in the expected direction
 *            within 24 wall-clock hours (flow does NOT freeze at close
 *            — it's a market-microstructure signal, not oracle-relative).
 *
 * All outcomes are hard-mapped in code; the LLM never sees these.
