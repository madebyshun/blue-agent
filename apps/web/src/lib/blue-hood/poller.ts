/**
 * Blue Hood — one poll cycle.
 *
 * Called by the 60s scheduler (/api/cron/blue-hood/poll). Fans out M5
 * (`rh-stock-arb`) across the watchlist and reshapes each response into a
 * `TickerSnapshot`. Writes:
 *   • `bh:snapshot:latest` — read path for /hood + the rule engine
 *   • `bh:snapshot:hour:YYYYMMDDHH` — ring buffer for the sparkline / history
 *
 * ── Rate-limit strategy (T1) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * GeckoTerminal's free tier caps at ~30 req/min. The earlier "batch 8×"
 * approach burst all 24 tokens in <2s and got rate-limited from position ~9
 * onwards ("alphabet cutoff" at INTC). This poller now runs SEQUENTIAL with
 * a stagger delay so 24 tokens land across ~60s, which sits under GT's
 * cap and gives the memo layer time to reuse.
 *
 * The exact stagger is `BH_POLL_STAGGER_MS` (default 2500ms → 60s cycle).
 * On a warm handler the 60s memo TTL in `rwa-market.ts` means a same-token
 * re-poll one cycle later still hits network (memo just expired) — that's
 * intentional; we want fresh prices, not stale ones.

 * any of three unrelated events — the cron never ran, it ran and nothing
 * priced (`mergeSeriesPoint` returns null on zero rows), or it ran and a KV
 * error made the writer refuse to write rather than clobber the day. Nothing
 * in the stored data tells them apart, and this function does not pretend
 * otherwise. It answers only the question that IS answerable: which hours we
 * expected and did not get. A consumer that plots `points` without asking will
 * connect 03:00 straight to 09:00 and draw a confident line through six hours
 * that were never observed.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT A HOLE — an absent hour is evidence of loss only
 * where recording was both already running and already finished:
 *
 *  • Before the archive existed. On `SERIES_ARCHIVE_START` recording began
 *    whenever the deploy landed; the earliest point we hold is the only record
 *    of when, so nothing before it was ever promised. Counting those hours
 *    would put a permanent, unfixable gap on the archive's first day.
 *  • The future — including the hour running right now. The poll appends at
 *    ~:05, so calling the current hour overdue would manufacture a gap for
 *    five minutes out of every sixty and teach every consumer to ignore the
 *    field. Conservative by design: a genuinely dead writer surfaces one hour
 *    later than it could, which is the cheaper of the two errors.
 *
 * `now` is a parameter, not `new Date()`, so the window is testable at any
 * wall-clock time instead of only between 03:00 and 23:00 UTC.
