/**
 * Blue Hood — arrow rule engine.
 *
 * Walks a fresh snapshot, decides which tickers deserve an arrow, and hands
 * them to the persistence layer to fire. Every rule matches the public
 * spec exactly (see docs/blue-hood/arrow-rules.md). The engine NEVER
 * generates numbers on its own — thresholds are literal constants, the
 * snapshot fields are the source of truth.
 *
 * A single-cycle guarantee: dedup keys live in KV under
 * `bh:arrow:open:{ticker}:{type}`. If an open arrow already exists for
 * that (ticker, type) we do NOT fire again; the previous arrow will grade
 * itself before we look at that pair again.
 *
 * MVP note: this file lands drift + arb only. Flow (D2) needs D2 in the
 * snapshot; whale (D1) is informational and heavy (1h/cadence) — both
 * land in a follow-up commit so the drift board can ship first.

// re-typing "2.0" in the UI would let the printed threshold silently diverge
// from the one that actually fires. Both are imported above.
// Dust floor — same as M4/M5 already enforce. Reads TOTAL token
// liquidity (`row.total_tvl_usd`), NOT `row.tvl_usd` (which is only
// primary-pool depth). Old check on primary-pool-only was blackholing
// tokens like NVDA whose bankr-robinhood WETH pool ($21M) dwarfs the
// USDG pool ($850k) — the engine was blind to the deepest pools on
// chain. Fallback to `tvl_usd` for rows that predate `total_tvl_usd`

// P1 (2026-08-13) — DEAD-POOL LIVENESS GATE, drift only.
//
// A pool with no trades cannot move. When the DEX print is frozen and the
// oracle keeps ticking, `drift_pct` grows purely because the ORACLE walked
// away from a stale print — nothing drifted, and there is no basis for the
// arrow's claim that the two prices converge. The gap-closure decomposition
// (`scripts/gap-closure-dryrun.ts`, 2026-08-12) measured 8/24 tickers
// dead-or-noisy, accounting for 51% of graded drift arrows; BABA's print was
// bit-identical across 100% of archive hours, SPCX 98%.
//
// THRESHOLD IS MEASURED, NOT GUESSED. Swept the already-persisted
// `snapshot_at_fire.dex_volume_24h_usd` over all 117 graded drift arrows:
//
//   thr      kept  hits  rate   cut  cut_hits cut_rate
//   0        117    69   59%      0     -        -
//   1        103    66   64%     14     3       21%
//   1000      97    62   63%     20     7       35%
//   10000     76    49   64%     41    20       48%
//   50000     49    31   63%     68    38       55%
//
// The ENTIRE effect sits at the `> 0` boundary: cutting the 14 zero-volume
// arrows (which hit only 3/14 = 21%) lifts 59% → 64%, and every higher floor
// cuts more arrows for no additional gain. Raising this is a dead lever
// exactly like `DRIFT_MIN_ABS_PCT` already is — do not "tighten" it without
// new data. The 14 cut arrows are exactly BABA (9) + SPCX (5): the same two
// tickers the independent frozen-print audit flagged, which is why BABA's
// 11% hit rate is a measurement artifact rather than a weak signal.
//
// ⚠️ THIS GATE IS NARROWER THAN THE "51% OF ARROWS" HEADLINE — do not conflate
// them. That 51% counts every ticker flagged dead OR noisy (8/24). This gate
// only catches pools with literally zero 24h volume, which is BABA + SPCX =
// 14/117 arrows (12%). AMD, COIN and SLV are frozen ≥50% of archive HOURS yet
// still report real 24h volume, so they keep firing; ORCL (4.1× oracle vol)
// and NVDA (3.4×) are noisy rather than dead and are not touched either — and
// they hit 42% and 64%, so there is no measured case for gating noise. The
// remaining dead/noisy exposure is a known, deliberate gap, not an oversight.
//
// FORWARD-ONLY. This changes which arrows FIRE; it rewrites nothing already
// published. The public rate does not jump 59% → 64% on merge — it drifts
// there as new arrows accumulate. Anyone quoting 64% before then is quoting a
// counterfactual, not the record.
//
// Coherence: `rh-stock-arb.ts` does `const dex = primary.pool` and reads both
// `price_usd` and `volume_24h_usd` off that SAME object, so gating the price
// on the volume is not comparing two different pools.
//
// Drift only, on purpose. Arb's zero-volume record is n=2 (0 hits) — real but
// far too small to gate on, and arb fires while the market is OPEN, where the
// frozen-oracle mechanic that motivates this gate does not apply.
