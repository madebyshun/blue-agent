/**
 * Blue Chat — Cron Task Runner
 *
 * Executes a stored cron prompt through the SAME real-data pipeline the live
 * chat uses (`/api/chat`), then returns the final plain-text result.
 *
 * WHY proxy through /api/chat instead of calling the LLM directly:
 *   The previous version POSTed the prompt straight to the Bankr LLM with NO
 *   tools attached. That meant scheduled tasks like `/pick` produced
 *   FABRICATED output — the model free-associated a token pick with no live
 *   data behind it. /api/chat gives the model the full HUB_TOOLS set
 *   (hub_token_pick → token-pick-signal, hub_ecosystem → ecosystem-digest,
 *   hub_narrative → narrative-position, …), each backed by real on-chain /
 *   market data. Routing through it keeps cron results grounded in real data
 *   and avoids duplicating (and drifting) the tool catalog.
 *
 * Rule: real-data, the LLM must NOT fabricate data.
 *
 * PRIVILEGE: none. This route is reachable by anyone — it is the "Run now"
 * button, called straight from the browser — so it must never hold authority
 * the caller doesn't already have. It used to attach INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY while
 * forwarding no wallet, which is precisely the combination `/api/chat` reads as
 * "authorized server job with no end-user" and answers by free-bypassing the
 * x402 paywall on every paid Hub tool. Anyone who could POST here could spend
 * the operator's tool budget anonymously. Forwarding the caller's own address
 * instead makes a scheduled run cost exactly what typing the same prompt into
 * the composer costs, which is the only defensible price for it.
 *
 * WHO the caller is — proven since 2026-09-30 (plan §2, W0-6). Until then the
 * "caller's own address" was just `body.address`: anyone could run a prompt
 * billed to a stranger, and a request with no address ran as a guest — a paid
 * model, billed to no one. Now the wallet comes from lib/acting-wallet.ts: the
 * SIWE session (the browser's "Run now") or the internal key + x-blue-user (the
 * user-tasks cron, acting for the owner it read from that owner's own task
 * list). No proof, no run. The chat pipeline is then called as that wallet —
 * internal key + x-blue-user — so it re-checks nothing it cannot and bills
 * exactly that wallet, never a free bypass.

 * Read the chat route's SSE stream and accumulate the assistant text.
 * Handles both event shapes the chat route emits:
 *   - synthetic / Bankr:  { delta: { text } }
 *   - raw Anthropic:      { type: "content_block_delta", delta: { type: "text_delta", text } }
 * Both expose the chunk at `delta.text`, so reading that covers every case.
 * Tool-chip events (tool_start / tool_done / web_search_used) and
 * thinking_delta carry no `delta.text` and are skipped.
 *
 * `insufficient_credits` is pulled out as its own field rather than left to fall
 * through the text accumulator. /api/chat reports an empty balance as a normal
 * HTTP 200 stream carrying one event with no `delta.text`, so a text-only reader
 * sees a successful run that returned "" — indistinguishable from a model that
 * had nothing to say. Both callers need to tell those apart: the "Run now"
 * button should say "top up", and the scheduler must PAUSE the task instead of
 * retrying a run that cannot succeed every five minutes forever.
