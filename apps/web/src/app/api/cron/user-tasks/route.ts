/**
 * Blue Chat — the tick that makes "daily at 09:00" mean 09:00.
 *
 * Runs every 5 minutes from `vercel.json`. Everything below is shaped by two
 * facts that make this different from the other crons in this repo: it spends
 * REAL USER CREDITS, and it runs against a KV budget that has been exceeded
 * three times (#148).
 *
 * ── Cost per idle tick: ONE read ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The first thing this route does is read `crons:next`, a single integer: the
 * earliest moment any owner has a task due. If that is in the future, it returns
 * immediately — it does not read the owners set, and it does not touch a single
 * wallet record. 288 ticks/day × 1 read ≈ 8.6k reads/month, flat, no matter how
 * many users enrol. The naive shape (scan every owner every 5 minutes) costs
 * 288 × N reads/day and would put the project back in suspension at a few
 * hundred users. `unset` means nobody has ever enrolled, and is also a return.
 *
 * ── Missed windows are SKIPPED, never replayed ───────────────────────────────
 * `nextFireAt` always returns a future instant, so a task whose window passed
 * while the app was down runs ONCE, at the next window. This is the single most
 * important behaviour here: each run debits credits and can call paid tools, so
 * "catch up on the seven runs you missed" is a way to empty a wallet overnight.
 * Losing a run is recoverable; charging for six the user never asked for is not.
 *
 * ── Out of credits pauses the task, it does not retry it ─────────────────────
 * `/api/cron/run` reports insufficient credits as a structured field rather than
 * an error string. When we see it, the task is switched off with a
 * `pausedReason` the panel renders. The alternative — leave it active — means
 * re-attempting a run that cannot succeed every 5 minutes forever, which burns
 * the tool budget and the KV budget to produce nothing. The user re-enables it
 * after topping up, which also clears the reason.
 *
 * ── One tick at a time, and only a few runs per tick ─────────────────────────
 * A `kvTryLock` guard stops two overlapping invocations from double-charging the
 * same task, and `MAX_RUNS_PER_TICK` bounds how much money one tick can spend if
 * something goes wrong upstream. Anything not reached this tick is still due
 * next tick — the watermark is left where it belongs.
 *
 * Auth: `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (or `?secret=`) — the house pattern.
