/**
 * ACP wrapper: Blue Hood arrows feed (public track record).
 *
 * Public GET. Reads the same filtered arrow feed the drift-board UI
 * reads, wrapped in the ACP envelope.
 *
 * ⚠ This header used to claim it "reuses /api/hood/arrows server-side to avoid
 * duplicating the origin/test filter (single source of truth for what's
 * public)". It did no such thing — it carried its own hand-written copy of the
 * predicate, directly beneath a comment asserting it didn't. Fixed 2026-08-27:
 * the filter now genuinely comes from `readPublicArrowsProbe`, and the read
 * goes through the hydrated blob (#148 ②) so one GET costs 1 KV command
 * instead of ~151.
