// Crypto holdings on Robinhood Chain 4663, for the Wallet surface.
//
// This is a THIRD wallet read, not a parameter on an existing one, because the
// two chains share no reader and no state:
//   /api/wallet/holdings  → Moralis      → Base only (Moralis does not index RH)
//   /api/wallet/stocks    → registry     → equities on BOTH chains
//   this route            → Blockscout   → everything else on RH
// Folding RH into /api/wallet/holdings would mean one response whose rows came
// from two different indexers with two different trust models, on chains whose
// explorers are not interchangeable.
//
// Mainnet only — RH has no testnet leg here, and the caller mounts it under the
// same `!isTestnet` guard as the stock table.
//
// ZERO fabrication: prices are Blockscout's own exchange_rate, an unpriced token
// stays unpriced, and an explorer that did not answer returns
// `status:"unavailable"` rather than an empty portfolio.

// Since 2026-09-13 the read is BOUNDED rather than merely expected to be quick:
// each leg carries its own timeout and the sequential walk carries a wall-clock
// budget (see `blockscout.ts`, which has the measurements that set them). Worst
// case is ~45s — every page timing out on both attempts — and the response is
// still a real, correctly-flagged partial read rather than a hung request. That
// is what this ceiling has to clear; the default 10s would not.
