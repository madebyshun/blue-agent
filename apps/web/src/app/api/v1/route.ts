/**
 * /api/v1 — machine-readable index of the legacy API alias.
 *
 * Every id listed here is callable at POST /api/v1/<id>, which re-exports the
 * canonical /api/x402/<id> handler. This index is what an autonomous agent
 * reads to decide WHICH tool to call and HOW MUCH to budget for it.
 *
 * ⚠ DERIVED FROM `AGENT_TOOLS` ON PURPOSE — never hand-maintain this list.
 *
 * It used to be a hardcoded array of 37 entries, and by 2026-08-28 it had
 * rotted in all three possible directions at once (measured against the live
 * catalog, not estimated):
 *
 *   • 25 of 37 PRICES were wrong. Not rounding — `key-exposure` advertised
 *     $0.15 against a real $0.50 (3.3× under), `competitor-scan` $0.75 against
 *     $0.20 (3.75× over). An agent budgeting off this index either underfunds
 *     the call and gets a 402, or overpays. Prices are the one field a paying
 *     machine cannot sanity-check for itself.
 *   • 2 GHOST ids (`allowance-audit`, `phishing-scan`) were advertised but had
 *     no handler — and no catalog entry either, so calling them now returns
 *     404 UNKNOWN_TOOL_ID. Until 2026-09-28 they got a 501 promising "the
 *     catalog listing will be removed shortly": a promise this file never
 *     kept, about a listing that never existed.
 *   • 77 of 112 real tools were MISSING, so 69% of the surface was
 *     undiscoverable to any agent that trusted this endpoint.
 *
 * Deriving makes all three unrepresentable: the price is the catalog's price,
 * a ghost cannot appear because the filter requires a live HANDLER entry, and
 * a new tool shows up the moment it is registered. Same single-source-of-truth
 * discipline `.well-known/openapi.json` already uses.
