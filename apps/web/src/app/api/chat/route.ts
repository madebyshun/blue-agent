/**
 * Blue Agent — Chat API with Hub Tool Routing

 * Flow:
 *   1. Non-streaming LLM call with tool definitions → detect intent
 *   2a. Tool use detected → execute Hub tool → streaming LLM call to format result
 *   2b. No tool use → convert response to SSE stream
 *
 * When a tool call fails it returns an error message and the model is told, in
 * that same message, to report the failure and NOT to substitute a value from
 * training data. This comment used to read "LLM falls back to answering from
 * knowledge. Nothing breaks." — it did break, silently, and the fix is #204.

// MOVED to ./system-prompt.ts (2026-09-06). It was a template literal here, and
// a Next.js `route.ts` may only export route handlers plus a fixed config set —
// so nothing inline in this file can be imported by a test. The prompt is
// precisely the thing that went wrong, in a way no type checker can see, so it
// had to become a plain module with a plain return value that
// `scripts/chat-tool-honesty-check.ts` can assert against.
//
// Both builders take `hasTools`. That parameter is the fix: a request arrives
// tool-free on FOUR paths — `freeNoTools`, `isE2EE`, `knowledgeOnly`, and a
// failed Phase 1 — and every one of them used to fall through carrying a prompt
// that said "you have real-time Hub tools" and taught the exact shape of a tool
// receipt. Read that module's header for the prod evidence.

// ─── Integration prompt sections (conditionally appended) ─────────────────────

// Base MCP — the `baseMcp` toggle used to append a section here telling the
// model it had seven mcp.base.org tools (get_wallets / send / swap / sign /
// send_calls / get_request_status / chain_rpc_request).
//
// It never did. No schema for any of them was ever registered on the request,
// so the model was told it could move funds and then had no tool to do it with
// — the failure mode being that it narrates a swap and invents an approvalUrl
// instead of erroring. Describing a capability in a prompt does not create it;
// a tool exists only when its schema is on the request.
//
// The section is deliberately NOT replaced with a weaker prompt. When Base MCP
// is wired for real it should ride the connector path (/api/mcp-client probes
// the server, /api/chat namespaces its tools `mcp__<id>__<tool>` and routes
// tool_use back) — the same plumbing every other MCP server already uses, which
// registers real schemas instead of describing imaginary ones.
//
// `baseMcp` remains in the request body so existing clients don't break; it is
// simply inert until that wiring lands.

// Coinbase MCP — REMOVED 2026-09-06, for exactly the reason written above the
// Base MCP block. The `coinbase` toggle appended a section opening "You have
// access to Coinbase spot trading: 900+ trading pairs, Portfolio management,
// USDC/USD conversions".
//
// It did not. `grep coinbase` over this route finds the body field, this
// section, and nothing else — no schema in VENICE_TOOLS, no TOOL_ENDPOINT
// entry, no handler. So the model was told it could place spot orders and given
// no way to place one, which is the identical defect the Base MCP block
// documents, on a funds-touching capability. Its own "SAFETY RULES" made it
// worse rather than better: "ALWAYS show fees + estimated fill price" is an
// instruction to produce numbers, and with no tool to produce them from, the
// only available source is invention.
//
// `coinbase` stays in the request body so existing clients keep working; it is
// inert until a real Coinbase tool is registered, at which point it belongs on
// the connector path like every other MCP server.

// B20 / Beryl awareness — MOVED to ./system-prompt.ts (2026-09-06, #205).
// It used to be a `B20_SECTION` constant here, appended unconditionally, and the
// comment justifying that said: "background knowledge about a token standard,
// not a claim about what this request can do." Half of it was. The other half
// was a dispatch table naming twelve tools ("Use hub_b20_inspect when…"), which
// is exactly a claim about this request's capability — so the tool-free prompt
// kept advertising tools even after #407 gated the tool list. It lives in
// `system-prompt.ts` now because a `route.ts` may only export route handlers,
// which is what kept it out of reach of the guard in the first place.

  //
  // Removing the OFFER is the risk-reducing half and is safe to do alone. The

 *   "tools"       — run them.
 *   "none"        — the model looked and chose not to; tools were genuinely
 *                   available, so the prompt may keep describing them.
 *   "unreachable" — nothing was asked and nothing could have been. The caller
 *                   MUST rebuild the system prompt with `hasTools: false`
 *                   before streaming, or it hands the model a tool list and no

| Packs | USDC top-up on Base | Carries over |

**How to get more credits:**
- Connect any Base wallet → daily allowance jumps to 500 (free, no token to hold)
- Beyond the daily bucket → buy a USDC credit pack on Base (pay-per-use, no subscription)
- Hub tools stay pay-per-call in USDC

Keep it short, practical, and actionable.`,

"best APY on Base right now?"
"deploy a B20 stablecoin called vUSD"
"what's the narrative on Base this week?"
"analyze this B20 contract: 0x..."
"screen this wallet for AML risks: 0x..."
"compare Aave vs Morpho yields"
