/**
 * Public read of the latest Blue Hood snapshot.
 *
 * `/hood` calls this on mount + on a client-side timer so it doesn't need
 * to hit KV directly from React. Read-only, public, cache-busting headers
 * — no secret required.
 *
 * WHY kvGetProbe (not kvGet): a swallowed KV throw returns null, which the old
 * code reported as "Poller hasn't run" — the exact blind message that masked
 * the 2026-07-27 Upstash-cap outage. We now probe WITHOUT swallowing and split
 * the 503 into two honest causes so the board never blames the poller for what
 * is actually a monitoring blackout. `reason` is machine-readable so the client
 * can pick a banner; the richer WHY lives at `/api/hood/health`.
