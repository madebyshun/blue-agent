/**
 * Public read of the Blue Hood arrow feed + hit-rate.
 *
 * Returns the last N arrows (newest first) plus computed 7d hit rate. UI
 * uses this to render the Arrows feed section. Read-only and public — same
 * shape as /api/hood/snapshot.
 *
 * CDN-CACHED, deliberately (was `no-store` until the second Upstash
 * suspension). The bill for this route used to be OPEN TABS × FEED LENGTH:
 * three clients poll every 15s, and each GET cost 1 + min(400, feed length)
 * KV commands — an index read plus one read per arrow. A single open
 * /app/hood/arrows tab was ~2.3M KV commands/day, which is how a 500K/month
 * allowance died in about five hours.
 *
 * Both terms are now gone:
 *   • `s-maxage` (#148 ①) killed the tab-count term — N tabs collapse to one
 *     origin read per 30s window.
 *   • the hydrated blob (#148 ②, `lib/blue-hood/arrow-cache.ts`) killed the
 *     fan-out — this handler reads ONE key and gets the arrow records with it.
 * ~401 commands per request became 1. The blob is a cache; `bh:arrow:feed`
 * and `bh:arrow:{id}` are still the source of truth and are never written here.
 *
 * 30s is far inside the data's own refresh rate — the engine polls every 300s
 * and arrows fire single digits per day — so this trades no freshness a user
 * could perceive. `max-age=0` keeps the BROWSER revalidating every time, so
 * the shared edge cache is the only thing serving stale, never a private one.
 *
 * ① and ② both attacked REQUEST COUNT. What was left is per-response SIZE:
 * `?limit=200` — the URL the Inbox and the Track Record both poll — ships
 * 49,771 B gzip, of which 26.3% is four fields no client renders. The default
 * list now omits them and says so in the payload; `?fields=full` returns the
 * complete record. Nothing is deleted — see lib/blue-hood/arrow-fields.ts.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS ROUTE CAN NOW 503. It could not before ②, and the reasoning below
 * changed with it — read the CACHE_CONTROL note rather than assuming.

/**
 * Shared-edge cache only. `public` + `s-maxage` = the CDN may hold it for 30s;
 * `max-age=0` = the browser may not, so no user ever reads a private stale copy.
 *
 * ⚠ THE PREMISE OF THIS CONSTANT CHANGED IN #148 ②. It used to read: "SWR is
 * safe here because this route cannot 503 — a KV outage surfaces as
 * `{ok:true, arrows:[]}`, so 60s of stale-but-true beats an empty feed
 * asserted as fact." That lie is now fixed (`readArrowFeed` probes, and the
 * handler 503s), so the old justification is void and the question had to be
 * re-asked from scratch rather than inherited.
 *
 * SWR still earns its place, for a DIFFERENT reason. The old warning — never
 * put SWR on a route that 503s, because the CDN will serve a cached 200 over a
 * real outage — is about /api/hood/snapshot, whose PURPOSE is to signal engine
 * state. This route's purpose is to show arrows. Serving arrows that are up to
 * 90s old (30s fresh + 60s stale) during a KV blip is true, useful, and
 * strictly better than an error page; past that window the 503 does surface.
 * Monitoring honesty lives on /api/hood/health and /api/hood/snapshot, which
 * carry no SWR, so nothing here can mask an outage from the thing watching it.
 *
 * APPLIED ON THE SUCCESS PATH ONLY. The 503 below ships `no-store` — caching an
 * error at the edge would strand every client behind it for the full window.
