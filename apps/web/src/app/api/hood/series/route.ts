/**
 * Public read of the permanent oracle-vs-DEX price archive.
 *
 *   GET /api/hood/series                       → today (UTC)
 *   GET /api/hood/series?day=20260810          → one day
 *   GET /api/hood/series?days=7                → last 7 days ending today
 *   GET /api/hood/series?from=20260810&to=20260817
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `bh:series:day:*` is the one Blue Hood key with no TTL, and
 * until this route there was no way to look at it. Verifying that the writer
 * even worked meant grepping serverless logs or pulling production secrets —
 * so the dataset the whole feature exists to protect was the one dataset
 * nobody could see. An append-only archive with no read path is indistinguish-
 * able from an archive that is silently empty.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS ROUTE ENFORCES: three different kinds of "no data" stay
 * distinguishable all the way to the consumer.
 *
 *   before_archive → we were not recording yet. Never will be; there is no
 *                    upstream to backfill from.
 *   miss           → we were recording and that day holds nothing.
 *   error          → KV could not be read. We do NOT know what that day holds.
 *
 * Collapsing `error` into an empty array is how a monitoring blackout gets
 * rendered as a flat market. `persistSeriesPoint` refuses to write on a failed
 * read for the same reason; this is the mirror of that guard on the read side.
 * A response containing any `error` day is also sent `no-store`, so a transient
 * KV blip can never be frozen into the CDN as that day's answer.
 *
 * THE SAME RULE, ONE LEVEL DOWN: a day that reads fine still hands back a
 * `points` array where an absent HOUR is equally ambiguous — no cron run, or
 * nothing priced, or a KV error the writer declined to overwrite. That is why
 * every hit carries `coverage`, and the window carries `contiguous`. We do not
 * claim to know why an hour is missing; we only refuse to let it go unsaid,
 * because a consumer that plots `points` blind draws a straight, confident
 * line across hours nobody ever observed.
 *
 * COST: one KV request per requested day, which is why the window is capped —
 * the Upstash request cap has starved this engine once already (task #123).
 * Days before the archive start cost nothing: the answer is known without
 * asking. Completed days are immutable and cached for a day; today and
 * yesterday still move (a cycle starting 23:58 UTC writes to yesterday's key
 * a couple of minutes after midnight) so they get 5 minutes.
 *
 * F6 — THIS IS A PUBLISHING DOOR OF THE RH DESK. The archive holds the same DEX
 * leg the quarantine withholds on the snapshot (lib/blue-hood/quarantine.ts),
 * so every served point goes through `publishRhArchivePoints` and the response
 * says `provenance`. The archive in KV stays raw — that is the recorder's job,
 * and the reason the numbers can be re-derived once the price source is fixed.
 * Coverage is computed from the points' HOURS, which the quarantine does not
 * touch, so the holes this route reports are the same either way.
