/**
 * GET /api/hub/builders/[address]/dashboard — creator dashboard data for one wallet.
 *
 * Aggregates BOTH registries the wallet can own tools in:
 *   • external (hub-registry)  — builder self-hosts the endpoint; 100/0 split,
 *                                paid DIRECT to the builder's wallet (see below).
 *                                Per-tool volume is tracked (hub:tools:revenue:<id>).
 *   • hosted   (hub-hosted)    — Blue Hub runs the tool; 90/10 split, Blue holds.
 *                                Earnings are POOLED per wallet (builder:earned:<wallet>),
 *                                not per-tool, so hosted items carry no per-tool figure —
 *                                the aggregate is returned once under earnings.hostedUnits.
 *
 * 🔴 THE TWO SOURCES MEAN OPPOSITE THINGS BY "EARNED", AND CONFLATING THEM IS
 * A CLAIM ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY. External tools settle at the BUILDER's own
 * endpoint: EIP-3009 has one recipient, that recipient is the builder, so the
 * USDC never touches Blue and there is nothing for Blue to pay out. Hosted tools
 * settle through Blue, so the hosted pool IS a balance Blue owes.
 *   external → `paidDirect: true`  — already in their wallet. Not claimable,
 *                                    because it was never held. An ESTIMATE:
 *                                    listed price × successful calls.
 *   hosted   → `paidDirect: false` — held by Blue, awaiting a payout mechanism.
 * This route published `splitPct: 95` for external until 2026-09-26, next to a
 * "ready to claim" panel and a Withdraw button. It was bookkeeping against a
 * splitter that has never existed, and the flow it described had never paid a
 * builder once — the Hub signed Blue's treasury and every builder's verifier
 * correctly refused. A builder reading that screen could reasonably have thought
 * Blue was holding 95% of their revenue for them. Do not merge these fields.
 *
 * Secrets never leave the server: external tools omit no secret (endpoint is public),
 * hosted tools go through toPublicHostedTool() inside readBuilderHostedTools() so
 * systemPrompt / authValue are stripped. All USDC figures are micro-units (6 decimals).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS ROUTE CARRIES `coverage` (#150 group B) ─────────────────────────
 * This response is assembled from FOUR independently-collapsing KV reads: the
 * external owner index, the hosted owner index, every per-tool counter behind
 * them, and the pooled `builder:earned:<wallet>` figure. Each one used to
 * degrade to `?? 0` / `?? []` on a KV throw, and the route then SUMMED them —
 * so a single throttled read (routine during the Upstash cap windows #123/#148)
 * produced a confident `earnings.totalUnits: 0` and `counts.total: 0`. The
 * dashboard rendered that as "$0.0000" and "No tools registered yet".
 *
 * Nothing was destroyed; the balance and the tools sat intact in KV. But this
 * is the one screen in the product that makes a claim about someone's money,
 * and the counter IS the record — there is no receipt to check it against — so
 * "we could not read it" and "you have earned nothing" must not share a
 * rendering. Hence:
 *
 *   • every earnings figure is `number | null`; null means UNREADABLE, never 0.
 *   • `totalUnits` is null if EITHER component is null. A total that silently
 *     drops an unknown component is precisely the bug — the components are
 *     still there for anyone who wants the floor.
 *   • `coverage` is the WORST of the reads, so a caller cannot pick the
 *     optimistic one by accident.
 *
 * A partial read is still worth serving: the tools we CAN see are real, and a
 * builder mid-outage is better off with nine of ten tools plus a warning than
 * with an error page.
