// Shared LLM client for Next.js API routes.
//
// LLM POLICY (2026-07-25): Virtuals is the ONLY provider used for synthesis
// across the whole stack. Bankr and Venice HTTP paths were removed from
// callLLM's fallback chain because a 3-rung chain was producing hard-to-read
// error traces (venice:error can literally say "Bankr LLM 403…" because Venice
// had an internal Bankr fallback) and hiding real Virtuals failures behind
// silent fabrication from the other rungs. Now:
//
//   • callLLM → Virtuals only. On failure, throws a typed LLM_UNAVAILABLE
//     error the caller can degrade around (e.g. blue-hood arrow still fires
//     with facts intact, brief:null).
//   • callVeniceLLM stays exported for legacy handlers still importing it —
//     it now delegates to callVirtualsLLM under the hood so no HTTP call ever
//     reaches api.venice.ai. Handlers should migrate to callLLM in follow-up
//     work; the shim is deliberate to keep the chain-strip PR small.
//   • callBankrLLM stays untouched at the file level so ~46 handlers that
//     directly import it keep compiling. Those calls are DEAD in prod today
//     (Bankr account 403 banned) — see the migration task that follows.
//
// Env: VIRTUALS_API_KEY (required), VIRTUALS_MODEL (optional).
//
// VENICE_INFERENCE_KEY is not read in this file — but it is NOT a dead env var,
// contra the older note here (and contra CLAUDE.md). Measured 2026-09-03, two
// live readers remain and the key IS set in Vercel:
//   • api/crypto-rpc/route.ts — backs the `hub_crypto_rpc` chat tool. Verified
//     working: a prod POST reached Venice and came back with a *semantic* error
//     ("Unsupported RPC network: base"), not 401/402. Auth is fine here.
//   • api/chat/route.ts — the `provider === "venice"` branch. Unreachable from
//     the web client (chatTier only ever holds a VIRTUALS_PRESETS_V1 id, none of
//     which start with "venice"), but still reachable by a direct API call,
//     because the route trusts the client-supplied `provider` field.
// The third reader, api/memory/embed, was retired 2026-09-03 — it had been
// answering 402 "Insufficient USD or Diem balance" on every chat message.
// So: do NOT unset this key during env cleanup.

// to null on prod for 4 straight CI runs (#11–#14) with error text

// Measured 2026-09-17, after the same null-provider symptom flapped the 6h

//
//   (a) DE-LISTED — the id is gone from /v1/models. Error text is a 4xx with
//       an "Invalid model provided" body. `getVirtualsCatalog()` catches this.
//   (b) BUDGET STARVED — the id is present and healthy, but this model is a
//       REASONING model and its reasoning is billed out of `max_tokens`
//       without ever appearing in `content`. Error text is
//       "empty response (content_len=0)" with finish_reason=length.
//       That is OUR bug, not the provider's. See REASONING_HEADROOM_TOKENS.
//
// Discriminate before blaming Virtuals: `GET /v1/models` is unauthenticated
// (see probeVirtuals), so checking whether the id is still listed costs one
// curl and takes seconds. On 2026-09-17 the id WAS listed (198 models) and
// trivial prompts answered 10/10 — every failure was (b).
//

 * a bogus bearer and a missing header both return 200 with 63 models). So a
 * catalog probe proves the host is up while saying nothing about whether OUR
 * key works. That would have made `/api/health` publish a green light with a
 * revoked `VIRTUALS_API_KEY` while every tool in the product failed — the same
 * class of lie as the old Bankr red light, only inverted. `/v1/chat/completions`
 * returns 403 without a valid key, so it actually discriminates.
 *
 * Cost is why this is cached, not why it's avoided: `max_tokens: 1` on the
 * flash model is a fraction of a cent, but the endpoint is public and
 * `no-store`, so an uncached probe would be an unmetered faucet on our
 * credits. The cache bounds it to one upstream call per TTL per instance.
 * (The *authenticated* `/api/hood/llm-health` still does a full uncached
 * `callLLM` — that one is gated behind `X-Blue-Internal` precisely so a public
 * caller can never trigger it.)
 *
 * Deliberately NOT reusing `getVirtualsCatalog()`: that helper serves a 6h
 * stale cache on failure, which is right for validating model ids and wrong
 * for health — it would keep reporting "ok" straight through an outage.
 *
 * NOTE: if this ever reports `error_403`, that is a TRUE signal about a gateway
 * we really depend on — unlike the pre-2026-08-18 Bankr 403, which reported a
 * provider that had already been removed from the code path.

//   "Claude Haiku 4.5" preset → id `anthropic-claude-haiku-4-5` — NOT in
//   the Virtuals /v1/models catalog. Every call became a 400. The preset
//   list was hardcoded, so no CI signal fired.
//
// Fix: single source of truth is Virtuals' own catalog. Both server
// (before dispatching a call) and client (when rendering the picker)
// validate against it. If an id disappears from the catalog, it
// disappears from the picker on the next 6h refresh — no code change
// required.
//
// The 4 preset ids below were verified live against the catalog on
// 2026-07-24 (see the "chốt preset" spec). The `-fast` variants are
// deliberately absent: 6× the price for the same capability.
// NAME NOTE: `VirtualsPreset` / `VIRTUALS_PRESETS` keep their original names
// even though the list is no longer Virtuals-only — same convention as
// `BANKR_TIERS` in ChatInput.tsx, which outlived Bankr. Renaming would touch 5
// files for zero behaviour change; the `provider` field below is what actually
// decides where a preset dispatches.
//
// WHY A PROVIDER FIELD NOW (2026-09-03). Blue Chat had TWO live upstreams and
// was only using one. `/api/chat` has a complete Venice branch (route.ts:2495)
// and `VENICE_INFERENCE_KEY` is set in Vercel Production — but the client
// derived the provider as `chatTier.startsWith("venice")` while every id the
// picker can produce comes from this list (fast/balanced/deep/private/grok).
// No id starts with "venice", so the Venice branch was unreachable from the
// web UI: a paid-for, keyed, fully-written provider that served 0% of traffic.
// ChatInput.tsx:614 documents the visible cost of that — the web-search button
// was deleted because search only works on Venice, and Venice couldn't be
// reached. Deriving the provider from the preset instead of from a string
// prefix is what makes both upstreams real.
//
// VERIFIED 2026-09-03 — every model id below was probed against its own
// provider with the REAL 46-tool HUB_TOOLS schema (~38.5k chars) and returned
// a correct `tool_calls` for a honeypot question. A capability flag in a
// catalog is a claim; a returned tool call is a measurement. Small models
// routinely accept the schema and then answer from training data instead of
// calling anything, which is invisible to the user — so "supportsFunction-
// Calling: true" was not accepted as sufficient for any entry here.

 * `RH RWA — Semantic Smoke` monitor:
 *
 * `deepseek-deepseek-v4-flash` (our VIRTUALS_DEFAULT_MODEL) is a REASONING
 * model. Virtuals bills its reasoning inside `usage.completion_tokens` and
 * spends it out of the SAME `max_tokens` pocket as the answer — but never
 * returns it in `message.content`. So `max_tokens` is not "how long may the
 * answer be", it is "reasoning + answer combined".
 *
 * A4 (`rh-stock-agent-brief`) asks for `maxTokens: 400`. Measured against the
 * exact A4 prompt, 12 consecutive calls at `max_tokens: 400`:
 *
 *     8 / 12 returned finish_reason="length" with content_len=0
 *     reasoning_tokens alone ranged 189 … 417   (avg 369)
 *
 * i.e. the reasoning phase ate the entire 400-token budget and the answer was
 * truncated to nothing. The same prompt at 1000/1500/2000 was 8/8 clean at
 * every budget. A second, unrelated analytic prompt at `max_tokens: 600` failed
 * 3/6 the same way — so this was never A4-specific, it hit every caller whose
 * prompt is complex enough to provoke real reasoning. Nine call sites pass
 * ≤ 600.
 *
 * This was NOT a Virtuals outage, though it presented as one: the catalog lists
 * the model (198 ids, id present, 2026-09-17) and trivial prompts answer 10/10.
 * The old error text said only "empty response (content_len=0)", which reads as
 * "the gateway returned nothing" and sent three investigations at the provider.
 * The throw below now names the real cause.
 *
 * Sizing: 1200. Peak reasoning observed across 36 probes was 1061 tokens (at a
 * 2000 budget); reasoning grows with the offered budget but saturates around
 * ~1100. Cost is ~$0.0001/call — and note the failure mode was the EXPENSIVE
 * one: a starved call still bills the full 400 tokens and returns nothing.
 *
 * Safe for non-reasoning models: they emit no reasoning tokens, stop at
 * `finish_reason: "stop"`, and are billed only for what they generate, so the
 * headroom is never spent. That matters because `VIRTUALS_MODEL` can point
 * anywhere in the catalog — this fix is not coupled to one model id.
