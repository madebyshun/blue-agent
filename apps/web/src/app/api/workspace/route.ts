/**
 * /api/workspace — the durable mirror of a user's Blue Chat state.
 *
 * GET    → read this wallet's workspace
 * PUT    → replace it
 * DELETE → stop syncing and remove the server copy
 *
 * ── The wallet comes from the SIWE session. Always. ──────────────────────────
 * There is no `?wallet=` and no `address` field in the body. That is the whole
 * reason `lib/session.ts` exists: the last per-wallet CRUD in this repo took
 * its wallet from the URL with no auth at all, which meant anyone could read or
 * overwrite anyone's record by typing a different address. It was retired
 * (#167, PR #367) rather than patched. This route is its authenticated
 * replacement, and it must not reintroduce the hole in a new shape.
 *
 * ── Failure must never be silent here ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The client mirrors localStorage → server and hydrates server → localStorage.
 * If a KV outage rendered as "empty workspace", hydration would blank a user's
 * conversation list and the next mirror would persist that blank. So both the
 * session read and the workspace read surface `unavailable` as a 503, and the
 * client is required to leave localStorage untouched when it sees one.
