/**
 * Shared helper for the 5 paid Console commands (idea / build / audit / ship / raise).
 * Each command is a thin handler that calls runConsoleCommand with its system
 * prompt; payment is handled upstream by /api/x402/[tool] (verify → run → settle).
 *
 * Migrated 2026-07-26 to callLLM (Virtuals-only). Old behavior split idea/raise
 * onto Venice (for real web search) and build/ship/audit onto Bankr directly.
 * Both providers are gone: Bankr is 403 banned in prod, Venice was removed by
 * the chain strip. Now all 5 commands run on Virtuals via callLLM and throw
 * LLM_UNAVAILABLE if that fails — the x402 route surfaces it as 502 with no
 * charge, same contract as before.
 *
 * `webSearch: true` used to unlock Venice's live search. Virtuals has no
 * search, so we swap in STATIC_KNOWLEDGE_DISCLAIMER on the system prompt for
 * those commands (idea / raise). The model still writes its answer, but the
 * caller gets a labelled low-confidence marker for anything fresh-fact-y.
