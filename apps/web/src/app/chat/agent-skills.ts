   *  `api/x402/[tool]` writes `recordCall(tool)`, `api/hub/tools/[id]/call`
   *  writes `recordCall(id)`, and `api/mcp` resolves through HUB_MAP to the

   *  The only non-catalog ids that are correct here are the five `blue_<cmd>`
   *  counters `/api/console` writes.
   *
   *  Fixed 2026-09-26: all 14 `hub_*` entries below were MCP names, so every
   *  bundle summed keys nothing has ever written and read a permanent 0. The
   *  hook only renders a count when > 0, so this failed SILENTLY — three
   *  bundles looked un-instrumented when they were merely mis-keyed, which is
   *  the same shape as a tool with real demand whose counter reads zero and
   *  gets retired for it. One of them, `hub_builder_score`, resolved to no tool
   *  on any surface at all. */
