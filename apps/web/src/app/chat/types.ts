// Blue Chat v2 — Shared Types

// The chat sub-nav has no tabs left, so there is no `ActiveTab` union any more.
// Each tab left the same way — promoted to a shell page, then deleted here once
// keeping both meant one surface behind two navs: "tools" → /hub, then "skills"
// + "connectors" → /skills, /connectors (2026-08), then "models" → /models
// (2026-09). Tools still run inside chat and a model is still picked per
// conversation; the composer dropdown in ChatInput is that control. Settings
// was never a tab — it opens as a modal from the sidebar account chip.
