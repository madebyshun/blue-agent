// Blue Chat "Tools" tab catalog.
//
// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: this list is DERIVED from lib/agent-tools.ts
// (AGENT_TOOLS) — the exact same catalog the Hub page (/hub) renders. That
// keeps the chat Tools tab and the Hub in sync (no more 51-vs-72 drift).
//
// Each Hub tool still needs two chat-specific bits the raw AGENT_TOOLS don't
// carry: a display `category` bucket and a `trigger` (the prompt inserted into
// the composer on click). We preserve the hand-tuned values for the tools that
// had them (CURATED, keyed by id) and fall back to a sensible derivation for
// the rest.
