  // TWO different things on this page are called "identity" and they answer
  // different questions. `identity` (further down, `useWalletIdentity`) is about
  // the WALLET — connector family, smart account, passkey. `identityCard` is
  // about the PERSON. Keeping the names apart is the point; conflating them is
  // how a greeting ends up addressing someone by their connector.
  //
  // The ladder is `resolveIdentity`, imported from
  // lib/identity/account-identity.ts and shared with the account menu in the app
  // shell and with /signup. That is the fix: this page had its own local ladder
  // (`name ?? fname ?? shortAddr`), inline in four places, with NO social rung at
  // all — so a user who signed in with Google, GitHub, Discord or email had a
  // real name in the shell's account menu directly above this header and a raw
  // `0x2266…608E` here, on the same screen, two inches apart: an identifier they
  // have never seen and did not choose. One ladder means the two places agree by
  // construction rather than by two copies happening to be edited together.
  //
  // `fname` goes THROUGH the ladder as `farcasterName` rather than being spliced
  // in after it. This call site used to do the splice itself — `who.source ===
  // "address" ? (fname ?? who.displayName) : …` — which produced the right
  // string with the WRONG PROVENANCE: the card still read `source: "address"`
  // while displaying a Farcaster handle, so every consumer that branches on
  // `source` (the greeting below is one) was reading a label that did not
  // describe the value beside it. The ladder now owns a `farcaster` rung at
  // exactly the rank the splice gave it — below a Basename, above a bare
  // address — and the label matches the value by construction.
  //
  // `usePrivyIdentity()` is a plain `useContext` and returns `null` on the
  // Privy-off tree, so this is safe to call unconditionally on both trees.

    //    set in the production project — measured, 42 vars, not one of them

    //    Same family as #143/#166: advertising something the product cannot do.

    //    The root cause is the gate itself. A CALENDAR DATE cannot know whether
    //    a feature shipped — it only knows that a day someone once expected it
    //    on has passed. The flag knows. Anything that announces B20 must be
    //    gated on `B20_ENABLED`, never on a date.
    //
    // 2. IT WAS NOT A MISSION. Per this list's own definition four lines up, a
    //    mission is advice about the user's position. This was a product
    //    announcement, and a date-gated one, so from 2026-06-25 it was

    //    three slots, still calling a 74-day-old upgrade news.

    // Those two hid each other. Because it never changed, it read as furniture
    // and nobody re-checked the claim; because the claim was in an "info" chip
    // rather than a control, nothing failed when it was wrong. The `Try` button
    // led to OrdersPanel, which — being honestly gated on the flag — told the
    // user the opposite in the same click: B20 settlement "goes live June 25",
    // future tense, 74 days after that date. Two surfaces, one flag, opposite
    // stories. OrdersPanel's copy is fixed in this commit too.

          The wallet used to carry its OWN wide <aside> — a WALLET header, an

          wallet-specific chrome sitting next to the app shell's real nav rail,

                                   ACTIVE chain alone, so a "Base $X / RH $Y"
                                   toggle would print a number for a chain we

                  has an entrance, it just stopped competing for one 2×2 grid:
                    Receive → renamed "Deposit" (same panel, `openAction("receive")`)
                    💵 Add  → a button INSIDE that panel, next to the QR, where
                              "put money in" actually belongs
                    🏦 Out  → beside it, under a "card ↔ bank" heading. It is an
                              EXIT from real funds, so it keeps a route by rule:
                              a user who cannot find "cash out" has money
                              stranded, not a missing button.

                  `can` rather than from `network === "base"`. A disabled button
                  that cannot say why reads as a bug; one that says "Swaps route
                  through Base mainnet" reads as a fact about the chain the user
                  just picked. */}

                    a NEGATIVE ("No Basename") the greeting can never say.

                    `?? fname` is gone though, and that is the price of keeping
                    it. A Farcaster username is not a Basename. With `fname`

                    saw a lit chip reading `@shun` in the slot whose unlit text
                    is "No Basename" — the chip asserting a Basename that does
                    not exist. Exactly the defect the passkey chip had two
                    paragraphs up. They still get greeted by name: `fname` is a
                    rung of its own on the shared ladder (`source: "farcaster"`),
                    ranked below a Basename and above a bare address, so the

              A "WALLET" card led the left column here, listing USDC, aUSDC,

              balance card in Section 1 already renders, from the same four
              variables, one screen-height apart — the same number written twice
              on one page, which is the defect the previous release fixed
              BETWEEN two pages. Two copies of one derivation is how a surface
              ends up disagreeing with itself; the wallet's own history has that
              happening three separate times (see the allocation card below).

              Its one non-duplicate pixel was the low-gas warning, which is why
              this is a merge and not a delete: that moved up into the Section 1
              ETH row, where it now also fires at exactly zero.

              A "YIELD RATES · BASE" board sat under it — the top four DefiLlama
              pools with comparison bars. The previous release gated it to
              holders only, on the argument that for them it was "context on the
              money they have in". It wasn't: it ranked FOUR pools, of which the
              user's was at most one, and the only action it offered was to go
              somewhere else. Context you can't act on is an advert with a
              smaller audience.

              With both gone the left column held nothing; the two surviving
              cards now stack in the 2b right rail (Mission Control over

                      `allMissions` is built by an if-chain that deliberately
                      pushes NOTHING on pending, failed or partial — an empty
                      list beats a confident wrong instruction. Correct in the

                      into "✓ All good": a GREEN all-clear over a wallet whose
                      balance we had just failed to read. Same shape as the
                      `$0.00` and the "No assets yet" this batch has been
                      closing, and the last one standing — the derivation was
                      honest and the rendering re-asserted underneath it.

                      "No actions needed" is a claim about the user's position.
                      `state === "complete"` is the only thing that licenses it,
                      exactly as `canAssertEmpty` licenses the empty branches
                      elsewhere. The other two branches say which fact is
                      missing, and the degraded one carries the way out. */}

                    asked whether a ratio existed (stables + priced ETH) — and
                    on a wallet holding dust ETH and no stables the card said
                    "No assets yet" and then drew "Stablecoin 0%" underneath.
                    Everything empty-able now hangs off `holdsAssets`, and the
                    bar is INSIDE this branch so it cannot escape again.

                    But `holdsAssets` answers "is there anything to chart", not
                    "did we manage to look" — it is derived from `pricedTotal`,
                    which is `(walletUsdc ?? 0) + inYield + …`, so an unread
                    balance reaches it as the number 0 and this card printed
                    "No assets yet" over a request that had failed. Same
                    sentence as the balance card's "$0.00", same cause, and the
                    module says only `canAssertEmpty` licenses it.

                    The branch order below is `resolveRead`'s own precedence,
                    deliberately: pending → rows → failed → partial → empty.
                    `holdsAssets` sits in the "rows" slot rather than
                    `body === "rows"` because it counts a leg this read does
                    not — a wallet holding only ETH has zero funded USDC legs
                    and is still not empty. */}

              one of which is being asked at a time, and a tab bar is the only
              form that states the other options exist while showing one.

          The plate is DARK in both states. It used to flip to `#4FC3F7` when
          closed — i.e. exactly when the logomark is the thing on it — and that
          is the reported logo-background bug, for a reason that is a property of
          the asset rather than a matter of taste:

          `/logomark.svg` is a JPEG (no alpha) clipped by an SVG path, and that
          path punches the mark's two vertical bars out as HOLES. So the negative
          space of the logo is transparent and whatever sits behind it becomes
          part of the mark. On the cyan plate the bars rendered cyan-on-blue —
          the logo's own counters filled with a colour it never contains — while
          on every other surface in the app (all dark) they read as intended.

          Same reason the img carries `rounded-md`: the artwork is a rounded
          square with a ~24% radius, so square corners clip the curve. Every
          other `/logomark.svg` in this repo is already wrapped in a `rounded-*`;
          the three in this file were the exceptions. */}
