/**
 * /hood — Blue Hood public terminal.
 *
 * Oracle-vs-DEX drift signals for tokenized stocks on Base (Coinbase B20)
 * and Robinhood Chain — every call graded in public. Public read-only —
 * no auth required. Wrapped by /app/layout AppShell so the sidebar +
 * mobile drawer render consistently with Chat / Hub / Launches.
 *
 * Data path: this page NEVER calls x402 tools directly. It reads from the
 * KV snapshot the poller writes (see /api/cron/blue-hood/poll). Zero cost
 * per page-view even under a Reddit hug.
