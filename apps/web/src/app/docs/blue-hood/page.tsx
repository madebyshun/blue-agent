/* 🔴 The Hub bullet below said "call any tool for $0.05" until 2026-09-26. That
   is a PRICE, stated as a flat fact, and it was wrong for 82 of the 110 tools.
   MEASURED from AGENT_TOOLS that day: 15 distinct prices from $0.005 to $5.00.
   $0.05 is merely the most common (28 tools, a quarter of the catalog), so a
   reader sizing a budget off this line was understating the top of the range by
   100x. Wrong counts waste a reader's time; a wrong price on a pay-per-call
   product is the one number they act on before money moves.
   Derived from the catalog now — the same fix STATS in _data.ts already carries.
   `priceUSDC` is the field to read, not `price`: it is an integer in 6-decimal
   USDC units, so it cannot be tripped up by a "$" or a missing trailing zero,
   and it is what the x402 route actually charges. Free tools (priceUSDC 0 —
   picks-check, rh-rwa-verify) are excluded from the floor on purpose, because
   "from $0.00" would describe the catalog as free. */

        <strong>Positioning.</strong> Tokenized stocks trade 24/7 onchain
        across Base (Coinbase B20) and Robinhood Chain, but their Chainlink
        oracles only tick 24/5. Plenty of venues own execution; nobody owns
        that oracle-vs-DEX drift, cross-pool discrepancy detection, or a
        public signal track record that grades every call. Blue Hood is
        BlueAgent&apos;s wedge in that gap.

        Blue Hood is built as four discrete layers. Each one has its own

        Every graded arrow and its outcome (HIT / MISS / VOID) is returned

        from it. But the <em>headline</em> number that bears our name (the
        aggregate %, per-type %, and record curve) stays hidden until the
        sample earns it: <strong>30 graded</strong> arrows in the trailing 7
        days for the aggregate, <strong>15</strong> of a type for that
        type&apos;s own number. Below the bar the API returns{" "}

        percentage. The record curve is a cumulative HIT−MISS walk
        (<code>basis: &quot;cumulative_hit_minus_miss&quot;</code>), not dollars —
        grading measures signal accuracy, not PnL.
