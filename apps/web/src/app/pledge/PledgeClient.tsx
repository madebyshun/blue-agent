/**
 * The live half of the pledge page.
 *
 * Everything a holder needs to make the decision — the warning, the address,
 * the steps — is server-rendered next door and does not depend on this file
 * loading. What lives here is the part that has to talk to the chain: the
 * totals, the lookup, and the ledger itself.
 *
 * ─── The rule this component exists to obey ─────────────────────────────────
 * NEVER render a failed read as an empty ledger. A spinner that resolves into
 * "0 pledges" is, to someone who sent tokens an hour ago, indistinguishable
 * from being robbed. Every failure mode below therefore has its own visible
 * state: `error` (we could not read at all), `degraded` (this chain failed,
 * numbers are the last known ones), `stale` (numbers are older than they look),
 * `truncated` (we hit a page cap and this list is short). None of them are
 * allowed to look like success.
 *
 * ─── Which percentages appear, and which do not ─────────────────────────────
 * The distinction is aggregate vs personal, not "percentages are dangerous".
 *
 * A CHAIN total ("0.00325% of Base supply pledged") is migration progress. It
 * has a named denominator, it belongs to nobody, and it answers the question
 * the page is actually for: how much of the old token has moved. That renders
 * always.
 *
 * A WALLET share is a different object. Beside someone's own pledge a
 * percentage reads as an entitlement however it is labelled, and until
 * `ALLOCATION_ANNOUNCED` there is no published ratio for it to be a share OF —
 * the two old supplies differ by 100×. So per-wallet shares are withheld
 * entirely, and what renders instead is the pair that needs no ratio to be
 * true: the amount received, and the transaction that proves it.
 *
 * When the ratio is published, the per-wallet number comes back as an ESTIMATE
 * and says so in its own label — the denominator keeps moving while the window
 * is open, so a firm-looking share before it closes is a share that will be
 * wrong.
