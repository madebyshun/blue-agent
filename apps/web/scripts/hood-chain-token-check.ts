/**
 * Blue Hood — regression guard: a BARE TICKER MUST NOT RESOLVE A TOKEN.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * NVDA, META, GOOGL and AAPL exist on BOTH Robinhood Chain (4663) and Base
 * (8453) — different contracts, on chains that share no state. So
 * `findByTicker("NVDA")` is not a lookup, it is a silent chain choice, and on
 * the arrow path it chose Robinhood every time, including for arrows that fired
 * on Base.
 *
 * Measured against production on 2026-09-08: the feed held 200 arrows spanning
 * 2026-08-17 → 2026-09-08 — 142 `robinhood`, 58 pre-`chain` (⟹ robinhood via
 * `chainOf`), and ZERO `base`. The Base desk had been live 16 days and had never
 * fired. Every site below was therefore real, reachable, wrong code with no
 * victim yet. That is the whole reason this landed when it did.
 *
 * FOUR SITES, ORDERED BY WHAT THEY ASSERTED
 * -----------------------------------------
 *   1. `alerts.ts` — `enrichFromArrow` attached the ROBINHOOD contract to a Base
 *      arrow and set `verified: true`. The DM then said "✓ verified canonical"
 *      over an address on a chain the arrow never touched. This is the worst of
 *      the four: not a wrong pixel, a VERIFIED CLAIM about a contract.
 *   2. `share/arrow/[serial]/{page,opengraph-image}.tsx` — the public permalink
 *      and its unfurl did the same, and the page linked the RH address to RH's
 *      Blockscout under the fixed label "Robinhood Chain". This is the track
 *      record people quote, and the OG image travels into timelines that never
 *      open the page.
 *   3. The watch star — `kvWatchTicker`/`isValidTicker`/`watchersForTicker` took
 *      a bare ticker, so ★ on the Base NVDA row read the RH star's state, wrote
 *      the RH subscription, and un-★ removed the RH one. Nothing errored; the
 *      user just got another desk's alerts.
 *   4. `cohort-stats.ts` — ticker cohorts were keyed on `a.ticker`, so a Base
 *      NVDA and a Robinhood NVDA landed in ONE cohort. This is the tooling of
 *      the chain question itself (#152): a small Base drift diluted into a large
 *      RH drift yields a clean, corrected, entirely wrong answer to "does Base
 *      produce drift?" — undetectable, because the arithmetic is fine.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD ROT SILENTLY, AND WHY EACH GROUP EXISTS
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *   • The single resolver (`chain-token.ts`) is only worth anything if nothing
 *     ROUTES AROUND IT. Group 2 is the load-bearing check: it re-derives the
 *     ticker-resolver names from the registries' OWN exports and then scans all
 *     of `src/` for `<resolver>(<something>.ticker)`. Rename a resolver, add a
 *     new one, and the guard follows — no hand-kept list to go stale (#205's
 *     `TOOL_NAMES` lesson, where an enumerated allow-list silently stopped
 *     covering the thing it named).
 *   • `chain` is REQUIRED and never defaulted on the resolver. A default
 *     parameter would recreate the bug while every other check still passes,
 *     so Group 1 asserts arity and the null-not-fallback contract directly.
 *   • ROBINHOOD MUST PAY NOTHING. Group 6 is the counter-assertion half: RH keys,
 *     RH cohort names and RH resolutions must be BYTE-IDENTICAL to before. A fix
 *     that silently re-keys 142 live arrows and every existing subscription is a
 *     worse bug than the one it fixes. Without Group 6 this file would pass on a
 *     "qualify everything" change that orphans production KV.
 *
 * Groups 1, 4b, 5, 6 are BEHAVIOURAL (real modules, real registries, no KV I/O —
 * `src/lib/kv.ts` builds its Redis clients inside functions, so importing
 * `watchlist.ts` touches nothing). Groups 2, 3, 4a are source assertions, for the
 * usual reason: React components and Next route handlers cannot be stood up in a
 * plain script.
 *
 * ⚠️ DESIGNED TO FAIL LOUDLY ON PRE-FIX CODE. `chain-token.ts` does not exist
 * before this change, so it is imported LAZILY inside a try and every `read()` is
 * defensive. A guard that dies on module resolution proves nothing; this one runs
 * to completion on `origin/main` and names each broken site.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/hood-chain-token-check.ts

 * must stay absent from a deliberately GROWING allowlist is a hand-kept list
 * wearing a different hat, and this file already says why that rots (#205's
 * `TOOL_NAMES`, where an enumerated list quietly stopped covering its subject).
 *
 * The distinction worth keeping: a stale fixture here fails LOUDLY, so it costs
 * a few minutes. The failure mode being guarded against — Base falling back to
 * RH's contract — is silent and ships a verified claim about the wrong chain.
 * Deriving keeps the loud failure for real regressions and removes it for desk
 * growth, which is a planned event, not a regression.
 *
 * Sorted, so the ticker chosen and the failure message are identical run to run.
 * `null` ⟹ the desks fully overlap and this property can no longer be stated;
 * Group 1 then FAILS by name rather than skipping, because a check that quietly
