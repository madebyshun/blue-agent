/**
 * Blue Chat — regression guard: the prompt may not describe tools the request
 * does not carry, and nothing may tell the model to answer from knowledge.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Prod share a204b617 (2026-09-06): the model wrote
 *
 *     🔍 hub_token_price → Live prices fetched.
 *     | ETH | $3,428 | -1.2% |         ← ETH measured that day: $2,405.63
 *
 * with an EMPTY tool log, plus a Base block height at chain id `0x328` (Base is
 * `0x2105`) and a "Blue Hood Arrow #0017" carrying RSI/gamma/confidence — three
 * fields Blue Hood does not compute, on a chain that has never fired an arrow.
 * Three different presets returned byte-identical numbers, which is recall, not
 * fetching.
 *
 * It was NOT a Free-tier bug: `fast` and `search` (paid, Virtuals) fabricated
 * the same figures. The mechanism was that the prompt described the Hub tool
 * list unconditionally and taught the exact shape of a tool receipt, while FOUR
 * separate paths deliver a request with no tools attached — `freeNoTools`,
 * `isE2EE`, `knowledgeOnly`, and Phase 1 failing. The model had the format and
 * no tool, so it filled the format from training data.
 *
 * CLAUDE.md: "prompts do not prevent hallucination; data sources do." So none of
 * the assertions below check for a warning. They check that the CLAIM is absent.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD ROT SILENTLY, AND WHY EACH NEEDS A TEST
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *   1. `hasTools: false` is a BRANCH, and branches get flattened. One "simplify"
 *      pass that drops the ternary restores the unconditional tool list, and
 *      nothing fails to compile. Asserted both ways — the tool-carrying prompt
 *      MUST still name tools — so a test that passes by naming nothing at all is
 *      itself a failure.
 *   2. THE RECEIPT TEMPLATE. The old rule 7 asked the model to open with
 *      "🔍 [tool] → [key result]". A receipt the model TYPES is unfalsifiable;
 *      the UI already renders a chip from the execution log. Re-adding a
 *      "transparency" line would look like an improvement.
 *   3. "ANSWER FROM KNOWLEDGE" IN A FAILURE PATH. The tool-error string used to
 *      end "— answering from knowledge", three lines from a prompt rule
 *      forbidding exactly that. It is one well-meaning edit away at all times,
 *      and it is the strongest position in the context: the last thing read
 *      before generation.
 *   4. `blue_dca` OFFERED WITHOUT A KEEPER. The card takes a real
 *      `approve(keeper, totalAllowance)` on USDC; `/api/cron/dca-executor` has
 *      never appeared in `vercel.json` on any branch. Offer and schedule must
 *      come back together — this asserts the COUPLING, not the removal, so
 *      re-enabling is legitimate the moment the cron is real.
 *   5. A PROMPT SECTION THE GUARD CANNOT SEE. This is the one that actually got
 *      through (#205). The first version of this file asserted against
 *      `buildBaseSystem(...)` alone, and passed — while the shipped prompt still
 *      named twelve tools, because `B20_SECTION` was a separate `route.ts`
 *      constant appended unconditionally to the same array. Checking a PART of
 *      the prompt reads exactly like checking the prompt. So the assertions
 *      below run against the full assembled tool-free system prompt, and a
 *      structural check reads the assembly array itself and fails on any new
 *      unconditional module constant — the shape of the bug, not the instance.
 *
 * Source-reading, not network: these are properties of the text we ship.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/chat-tool-honesty-check.ts
