/**
 * Control test for #150 Group A **part 2**.
 *
 * Run: `npx tsx scripts/kv-mutate-part2-test.ts` from `apps/web/`.
 * Hermetic: no KV env vars needed, it runs against the in-memory fallback.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS OVER scripts/kv-mutate-control-test.ts
 *
 * That script already proves the core property (`kvMutate` refuses to write on
 * a failed read) and is not repeated here. Part 2 introduces three things it
 * cannot catch, and those are the only things tested below:
 *
 *  G. TTL pass-through. Part 2 converted 8 writes that carried a TTL. If
 *     kvMutate dropped it, the key would become permanent (or, with a TTL added
 *     where there was none, expire early). Neither `tsc` nor `next build` nor
 *     the part-1 test can see that — it is silent until data quietly outlives
 *     or outruns its window. I audited all 12 writes by eye; this pins it.
 *
 *  H. `"failed"` — a read that succeeds and a WRITE that throws. Four routes
 *     branch on `res === "skipped" || res === "failed"` to answer HTTP 503.
 *     Part 1 never makes `kv.set` throw, so half of that condition ships
 *     unexercised.
 *
 *  I. GONE 2026-09-28, deleted with its subject — `picks-check` was retired, so
 *     the real `persistPickCheck` it drove no longer exists. See the inline note
 *     where it stood: the hazard it covered (append the durable record before
 *     clearing the queue) is still live and less protected in the alert drain.
 *     The letters are NOT renumbered; G/H/J/K keep the names every comment,
 *     commit message and issue already uses.
 *
 *  J/K. The brief-worker (added with the LAST part-2 site). This one is
 *     structurally different from every case above, and that is why it needs
 *     its own two groups:
 *
 *       – The bug is not "a read wipes the key it writes". `bh:brief:queue`
 *         survived a throttled read fine, because the empty-check returned
 *         before the write. The damage was elsewhere: the worker POPS ids, and
 *         a pop is destructive on its own. A throttled read of the ARROW then
 *         made the worker report `vanished from KV — dropping` about an arrow
 *         sitting safely in KV, with its id already gone from the queue. So J
 *         tests an HONESTY failure and K tests a LOSS failure, and the two
 *         controls have to assert different things.
 *
 *       – `processOne` cannot be exported (Next.js rejects non-handler exports
 *         from a `route.ts`), so J/K drive the REAL `POST` handler. That is the
 *         stronger test anyway: it exercises pop → process → re-queue as one
 *         piece, which is where the ordering bug would live.
 *
 *       – Every case here needs a SELECTIVE fault (`withReadFailureOn`). A
 *         blanket read failure cannot express "the queue read worked and the
 *         arrow read did not", which is the only shape that reaches the bug.
 *
 * Cases G, J and K are control PAIRS: the "before" shape is reimplemented
 * inline and asserted to be destructive (or dishonest), then the shipped code is
 * asserted not to be under the identical fault. Either half alone is decoration
 * — the old-shape assertion is what proves the new one is measuring something
 * real. J/K add a third leg: a HEALTHY-KV control, because "always answer
 * unavailable" and "always defer" would otherwise pass every fault case.

  // I drove the REAL exported `persistPickCheck` from
  // `_handlers/picks-check.ts`, which was deleted the same day: its writer
  // (`base-token-scan` in the hourly feed cron) went with Blue Feed on
  // 2026-09-02, both KV keys aged out in July, and the only reachable branch
  // answered `code: "feed_retired"`. A three-legged control pair for a function
  // that no longer ships proves nothing about what ships — so it went rather
  // than being retargeted at a copy, which is the very thing the header warns
  // against.
  //
  // What I was the ONLY test of: "append the durable record BEFORE clearing the
  // queue, and do not clear it at all if the append did not land." When I was
  // deleted this comment recorded that hazard as LIVE AND UNCOVERED in
  // `api/cron/blue-hood/alert-drain/route.ts` → `drainOne`, guarded strictly
  // worse than picks-check was: `persistPickCheck` wrapped the ordering in one
  // function and RETURNED whether the append landed, so a caller could not get
  // it wrong, while the drain called two `void` functions — `markAlertDelivered`
  // then `removeFromPending` — each bailing on a bare `return` when its `kvGet`
  // came back empty. Right order, no success check, so a silently no-opped stamp
  // still got its id cleared: exactly what I-B asserted must not happen.
  //
  // CLOSED the same day, 2026-09-28. Both stamps now go through `kvMutate` and
  // report an `AlertStampResult`; `removeFromPending` runs only behind
  // `alertStampLanded`. Coverage moved rather than vanished — `alert-engine-test.ts`
  // cases D-A…D-G are the same control-pair shape I had (old shape reimplemented
  // inline and asserted to LOSE the record, shipped route under the identical
  // fault asserted not to, plus healthy-KV legs so "never remove" cannot pass).
  // The fault there is selective and temporal, not a blanket read failure: a
  // blanket one trips the route's health gate and never hands a row to
  // `drainOne`, so it cannot reach the bug.
  //
  // Two things worth carrying forward. The fix found a SECOND collapse of the
  // same kind one layer up, in `peekPendingAlerts` — `kvGet` + `if (rec)` read a
  // throttle as a TTL expiry and DELETED the queue entry, losing the message and
  // not merely its cursor (D-F/D-G). And note what closed it: a deletion that
  // wrote down what it stopped covering. Do NOT read this deletion as a finding
