/**
 * Link liveness — every URL we publish must resolve to something we ship.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Surfaces get retired. The links that advertised them do not, because the
 * link lives in an email template, an OG tag or a cron digest that nobody
 * opens in dev. Blue Feed was retired and its published links had to be 301'd
 * afterwards, once they were already in the wild.
 *
 * The live example that motivated this file: `blueagent.dev/market` returned
 * 404 in production while TWO senders kept mailing it out — the subscribe
 * welcome email and the daily research-loop digest. Every subscriber got a
 * welcome email whose only call to action was dead. Nothing caught it because
 * nothing renders those emails in CI.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS
 * --------------
 * Every absolute `https://[app.]blueagent.dev/...` URL written anywhere in
 * src/ must resolve against what this app actually serves:
 *
 *   - App Router pages       (a directory with page.tsx)
 *   - App Router endpoints   (a directory with route.ts)
 *   - Static files in public/
 *   - next.config.ts redirects  (a 307 is not a 404)
 *   - middleware archived redirects (`pathname === "/x"` → 301)
 *
 * SCOPE: absolute outbound links only, deliberately. Internal <Link href>
 * navigation is exercised the moment anyone opens the site, so it fails fast
 * on its own. An absolute URL baked into an email is the opposite — it is only
 * ever read by the recipient, months later, and it is the one that damages
 * trust. Both incidents above were outbound links.
 *
 * A link ending in `/` or followed by a template hole (`${`) is a PREFIX, not
 * a path: `https://blueagent.dev/api/x402/${id}` only asserts that a dynamic
 * segment exists at that position. Those are checked as prefixes so the check
 * neither fabricates a concrete id nor waves the whole family through.
 *
