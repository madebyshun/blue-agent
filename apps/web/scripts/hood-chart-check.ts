/**
 * Blue Hood — regression guard for the per-ticker price chart (#229).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * `seriesCoverage` wrote the warning in prose, months before any chart existed:
 * "A consumer that plots `points` without asking will connect 03:00 straight to
 * 09:00 and draw a confident line through six hours." A chart is that consumer.
 * The warning was a comment, and a comment binds nobody — so this file turns it
 * into a check.
 *
 * The failure is quiet by construction. A bridged line is not a crash, a blank
 * page, or a wrong-looking number; it is a smooth, plausible, confident chart
 * that renders hours nobody observed. Nothing downstream can detect it, and the
 * reader has no way to know. That is why it needs a guard rather than review.
 *
 * WHAT ROTS, AND WHY EACH GROUP EXISTS
 * ------------------------------------
 *  1. Segment integrity — the bridge itself. Runs must be internally hourly and
 *     gaps must never be swallowed. Asserted against a fixture built to contain
 *     every kind of nothing at once.
 *  2. The five kinds of nothing stay five. Collapsing `unreadable` into
 *     `hour_absent` says a KV outage and a quiet market are the same event —
 *     the read-path twin of the bug `readSeriesDays` refuses on the fetch path.
 *  3. Leading absence is not a hole. Derived from a real property of the desk:
 *     tickers admitted later than the archive start exist RIGHT NOW, so the
 *     "not on the desk yet" path is live code, not a hypothetical.
 *  4. Vintage is read PER ITEM (#159). `v` dates the WRITER; a day stamped 2 can
 *     hold items written before the field existed. And `undefined` ≠ `null` —
 *     "never looked" is not "looked and found nothing".
 *  5. The deadband is a MEASUREMENT floor, and must not be fused to the FIRING
 *     thresholds. Sharing one constant would make a tuning of either silently
 *     drag the other.
 *  6. The chain differential. A chart is an assertion about ONE token, and
 *     NVDA/META/GOOGL/AAPL/TSLA are different tokens on the two chains. Same
 *     property `hood-detail-chain-check` pins for the detail panel.
 *  7. Liveness. Groups 1-6 test a module; the actual drawing happens in a
 *     `"use client"` tree no script can import, so that is checked at the source
 *     level — and a source-level check that stops finding its file passes
 *     vacuously forever. #370's lesson: an absence check without a liveness
 *     guard is decoration. Every scan below first asserts its target EXISTS.
 *
 * FIXTURES ARE DERIVED, NEVER TYPED
 * ---------------------------------
 * `hood-chain-token-check` rotted because it contained the literal "TSLA": the
 * ticker was RH-only when written, TSLA was later admitted to Base (#436), and
 * the check silently became a test of nothing. So every ticker here is read out
 * of the registries at runtime, and where a property needs a ticker with a
 * particular relationship to the desks, the guard FAILS LOUDLY if no such
 * ticker exists rather than skipping — a property that can no longer be
 * expressed must be re-stated by a human, not quietly dropped.
