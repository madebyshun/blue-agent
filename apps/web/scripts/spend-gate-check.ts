/**
 * Every card that SPENDS reads its balance through one hook, gates on the
 * three-outcome verdict, and writes no token's scale down.
 *
 * ─── Why this guard, and why it derives its own inputs ───────────────────────
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-07. Three chat cards move real funds on Robinhood Chain
 * (4663) and Base (8453) — send, swap, bridge. All three had hand-rolled the
 * same balance read, and all three had it wrong the same two ways:
 *
 *   ① the amount guard was `balance != null && amt > balance`, which is FALSE
 *      when the read FAILED, so an unreadable balance ENABLED the confirm
 *      button and sent the user to pay gas for a transaction that cannot
 *      settle — fail-open, in the one place a gate exists to fail closed;
 *
 *   ② the token's decimals were written down as `18` rather than read. USDG is
 *      6 (`0x5fc5…d168`) and it is Robinhood Chain's cash token, so a wallet
 *      holding 1,000 USDG read as 0.000000000001: "swap all my USDG" resolved
 *      to dust, and any real amount tripped the over-balance guard so the
 *      button said "Insufficient balance" and was DISABLED on a wallet that
 *      held plenty.
 *
 * The swap card had ALREADY FOUND ② and fixed one copy — the one at prepare
 * time, whose own comment says "Hardcoding 18 was a real bug: USDG has 6
 * decimals". Ninety lines above it, the copy that decides whether the button is
 * even clickable kept the bug for months. That is the whole reason this file
 * exists: the fix has to have one address, and a second copy has to be
 * impossible to add quietly.
 *
 * ─── Two properties, both derived ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A guard written as "check these three files for these three strings" would
 * be obsolete the day a fourth card lands, and its author would never know.
 * So nothing here is hand-listed:
 *
 *   THE FILE SET IS DERIVED, over ALL of `src/`. A "spender" is any file that
 *   both reads a balance and signs a transaction — `useSendTransaction`/
 *   `useWriteContract` together with a balance read. That is the SHAPE of the
 *   bug, not a name, so a fourth card cannot dodge the guard by being called
 *   something else.
 *
 *   The first version of this file scanned `src/app/chat/components` only. That
 *   directory bound was itself a hand-drawn boundary, and it was WRONG the day
 *   it shipped: widening to `src/` immediately turned up four more spenders
 *   carrying the same defect — the bank Convert card, both swap panels on
 *   /launches, and the Blue Hood sign panel, none of them chat cards. A guard
 *   that derives its predicate but hand-picks its haystack has only moved the
 *   hand-counting somewhere less visible.
 *
 *   THE DECIMALS ASSERTION IS DERIVED. It does not count occurrences of `18`
 *   and compare to a number someone tallied by hand — a tally goes stale on the
 *   first edit and its staleness looks like a pass. It asserts that the SCALE
 *   ARGUMENT of a units conversion contains no numeric literal at all, wherever
 *   that conversion appears. Every scale must come from `decimals()` on the
 *   token, from `useBalance`'s own response, or from the chain's
 *   `nativeCurrency`.
 *
 *   That is narrower than the blanket "no bare 18 anywhere" this file used to
 *   assert, and the narrowing is not a retreat — the blanket version was simply
 *   FALSE outside the three RH cards. `ToolCards.tsx` legitimately contains
 *   thirteen: a token-DEPLOY form whose `min={6} max={18}` and `variant ===
 *   "stablecoin" ? 6 : 18` are choosing the scale of a token that does not
 *   exist yet. Choosing a new token's decimals is not assuming an existing
 *   one's, and a guard that cannot tell those apart gets switched off. What is
 *   forbidden is a scale used to CONVERT — that is the operation the USDG bug
 *   was made of.
 *
 * ─── On the exclusion list ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One known-unfixed spender is excluded by name (see EXCLUDED). The exclusion
 * is SELF-RETIRING: the guard asserts an excluded file still FAILS the checks,
 * so the day someone fixes it the guard fails with "exclusion is stale". An
 * exclusion that outlives its reason is the thing this repo keeps getting
 * bitten by — see the header of scripts/run-tests.ts on opt-out discovery, and
 * CLAUDE.md's rule that a staleness timer would have protected Blue Sentinel
 * through the entire window it was leaking a secret.
 *
 * Hermetic: reads source off disk, no network, no KV. Auto-discovered by
 * `npm test` via the `-check.ts` suffix.

// ── strip(): source with comments and regexes removed ───────────────────────
/**
 * Return only the parts of `src` that EXECUTE.
 *
 * Mandatory before any "this token must NOT appear" assertion, for a reason
 * this repo has already paid for once: `archive-watch-check.ts` had a negative
 * check fail against a file that was clean, because the forbidden token
 * appeared in the comment explaining why it was absent. A negative source check
 * that sees comments is testing the documentation.
 *
 * Regex literals are tracked because of a specific false NEGATIVE: a regex like
 * /https?:\/\// ends in `/` `/`, which a naive scanner reads as the start of a
 * line comment and then eats the rest of the line — hiding anything after it.
 * The regex-position heuristic (a `/` following an operator or an opener starts
 * a regex, a `/` following a value is division) is the standard one and is
 * exact for the code in this directory.
 *
 * `dropStrings` produces the SECOND view, and the split is not a nicety — the
 * first draft of this guard had only the stripped-strings view and was wrong in
 * both directions at once:
 *
 *   - FALSE POSITIVE: `gate === "ok"` is a requirement whose whole payload is a
 *     string. With strings gone the file reads `gate ===` and the check failed
 *     on all three cards, which were correct.
 *   - FALSE NEGATIVE, and this is the one that mattered: a hand-rolled read
 *     writes `functionName: "balanceOf"` — a STRING. With strings gone,
 *     `!/balanceOf/` passed on precisely the code it exists to forbid.
 *
 * So: strings are KEPT by default, because the shape requirements are written
 * in them. They are dropped ONLY for the bare-number assertion, where the false
 * positives are cosmetic (`text-[18px]`, `p-18` and friends fill these cards)
 * and no scale is ever expressed as a string.

// ── the fail-open parser: any nullable value that gates a signature ─────────
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-08. Everything above is scoped to a BALANCE, and that scope
// was drawn from the first three examples rather than from the defect. The
// defect is one expression:
//
//     X != null && amount > X
//
// When the read of X FAILS, X is null, the whole term is FALSE, "not blocking",
// and the confirm button ENABLES. Nothing in that sentence mentions a balance.
// `ManagePanel.tsx` had it against a token's SUPPLY CAP — an unread cap enabled
// a mint that reverts — and the balance-scoped detector could not see it,
// because that panel reads no balance at all: it takes one as a prop.
//
// So this half targets the OPERATION, not a list of names. That distinction is
// the one lesson `literalScaleConversions` above already paid for: the check it
// replaced targeted the NUMBER (`no bare 18`) and was false everywhere a token's
// decimals were being CHOSEN rather than assumed. Targeting "variables called
// cap, allowance, nonce, quota" would repeat that mistake one rung up — it would
// pass the day someone names it `headroom`.
//
// The rule, in one sentence:
//
//   At every gate on a signature, no term may be a nullish-guarded comparison
//   against the guarded value ITSELF, unless the null case is resolved.
//
// Each clause is load-bearing, and each was measured:
//
//   "at every gate"  — reachability is the definition, not an optimisation. The
//     first draft skipped it and reported four false positives: two display
//     labels (`amtLabel`, `usdLabel`), a fail-CLOSED `willSkipApprove`, and a
//     match inside a comment. `X != null && X > 0` in a label is not a gate.
//
//   "against the guarded value itself" — `cap != null && amt > limit` is not
//     this bug; the null-guard is protecting a different read. Requiring the
//     comparison to name the SAME identifier is what took the false-positive
//     count to zero.
//
//   "unless the null case is resolved" — two ways, both already in this repo,
//     both behaviours rather than names: hand the comparison to `resolveSpend`,
//     which owns the null and returns `unverified`; or name the null case as a
//     sibling blocking term (`const unknown = bal === null` beside
//     `const unaffordable = bal !== null && amt > bal`, blocking on the OR).
//
// Only `!= null &&` is matched, never `== null ||`. Both gate kinds have the
// same polarity — `disabled={E}` and `if (E) return` both mean "E true ⇒ no
// signature" — so `X == null || …` is fail-CLOSED at both, and matching it
// flagged ToolCards' correct `if (n == null || !Number.isFinite(n)) return;`.
