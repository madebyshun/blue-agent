/**
 * Gate 2 semantic smoke — asserts BEHAVIOR, not just HTTP 200.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   • `TARGET` env set → HTTP mode. Hits `${TARGET}/api/x402/*` with the
 *     `X-Blue-Internal` bypass. Used in CI against prod. Requires
 *     `INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY` matching the deployment's value.
 *   • no `TARGET` → local mode. Imports HANDLERS directly, no HTTP, no
 *     secret needed. Fast iteration on assertions.
 *
 * Fails hard (exit 1) on any assertion mismatch — used in GitHub Actions
 * to gate PR merge + on 6h cron to catch prod drift.

// This script answers two DIFFERENT questions depending on how it was

//
//   schedule (0 */6 * * *) → MONITOR. "Is prod healthy right now?" A third-
//                            party gateway being down is a real incident and
//                            SHOULD go red.
//   pull_request           → GATE.    "Is it safe to merge this diff?" The
//                            script hits TARGET=blueagent.dev, i.e. PROD — it
//                            never executes the branch's code — so an upstream
//                            outage says nothing about the diff, yet it blocked
//                            the merge anyway.
//
// MEASURED 2026-09-07: that is exactly what happened to #416. Virtuals
// returned `content_len=0`, A4's `llm.provider` came back null, and a PR whose
// diff touches no rh-* handler and no LLM path went red. `main` itself was red
// in 3 of its last 4 runs for the same reason. A gate that a PR cannot pass by
// being correct, and cannot fail by being wrong, is not gating anything.
//
// So: assertions that depend on a THIRD-PARTY service are declared with
// `mustUpstream` and are advisory in gate mode. Everything about OUR OWN code
// — including how it degrades when that service is down — stays `must` and
// stays fatal in both modes. This narrows what can block a merge; it does not
// narrow what gets checked.
//
// ⚠️ ONE CAVEAT, LEARNED THE HARD WAY (2026-09-17). "Depends on a third party"
// is a statement about the CALL, not about the CAUSE. A `mustUpstream` failing
// does not prove the third party is at fault — the same symptom can be our own
// bug reached through their API. The A4 provider assertion below flapped for
// nine days and the `mustUpstream` label read as "Virtuals is flaky"; it was in
// fact our token budget, and the label helped it hide. Downgrading the SEVERITY
// of a third-party-dependent check is right. Concluding from the downgrade that
// a red run is someone else's problem is not. Whenever one of these fires,
// read the upstream error text before attributing it — which is why these
// assertions now carry that text in their detail string.

  // Matched by PREFIX, not equality, for a reason specific to this script — it
  // tests PROD, never the branch (see the workflow header), so under equality a
  // future rename would ALSO go red for the whole window between merging and
